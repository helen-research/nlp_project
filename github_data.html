Certifications
freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginning programmer around 300 hours to earn.
Each of these 30 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.
You can pull in these test suites through freeCodeCamp's CDN. This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local computer's development environment.
Once you’ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certification specific to you.
The one exception to this is in the event that we discover violations of our Academic Honesty Policy. When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.
Here are our six core certifications:

996.ICU
Please note that there exists NO other official account, app or merchandise except for the official domain and this repository.

中文版

The name 996.ICU refers to ""Work by '996', sick in ICU"", an ironic saying among Chinese developers, which means that by following the ""996"" work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

What is 996?
A ""996"" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 a.m.–9 p.m., 6 days per week) that has been gaining popularity. Serving a company that encourages the ""996"" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours per week.
Visit 996 working hour system on Wikipedia for more details.

The 996 shall disappear

Capitalists

Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba: '996' is a huge blessing.
Richard Liu, founder of JD.com: We will never force our employee to work as '996'.
However, as a result many anonymous employees says that there is a list of departments which ranked them by overtime hours. The shortest will take punishments. And the leaders never leave evidences when ask employees to work as '996'.
Bai Ya, founder of Youzan: This will definitely be a right decision when we look back in a few years

Principles and purposes


996.ICU is an initiative initiated by IT practitioners. We welcome people from other fields and other countries to join the discussion.


This is not a political movement. We firmly uphold the labor law and request employers to respect the legitimate rights and interests of their employees.


It is great progress from closed source to open source, and it will also be great progress from open source to emphasizing labor rights at the same time. What we want is to create an open source software license that advocates workers' rights.


We are willing to hear all positive and constructive proposals and advocate mature and responsible speech.


Expanding influence
Please feel free to translate 996.ICU's contents, adjust the format, add some contents or fix grammatical errors. Please note that adding too many translations is getting off the track.

Where are the issues?
Even with interaction limits on, the issues area was totally out of control.
So I personally decided to switch it off, not by GitHub or others.

Introduction
Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.
Browser Compatibility
Vue.js supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported).

React ·    
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

Learn how to use React in your own project.
Installation
React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need:

Use Online Playgrounds to get a taste of React.
Add React to a Website as a <script> tag in one minute.
Create a New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

You can use React as a <script> tag from a CDN, or as a react package on npm.
Documentation
You can find the React documentation on the website.
Check out the Getting Started page for a quick overview.
The documentation is divided into several sections:

Tutorial
Main Concepts
Advanced Guides
API Reference
Where to Get Support
Contributing Guide

You can improve it by sending pull requests to this repository.
Examples
We have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started:
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name=""Taylor"" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
This example will render ""Hello Taylor"" into a container on the page.
You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a <script> tag, read this section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended JavaScript toolchains handle it automatically.
Contributing
The main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.
Code of Conduct
Facebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.
Contributing Guide
Read our contributing guide to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React.
Good First Issues
To help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of good first issues that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.

TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation
using data flow graphs. The graph nodes represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow
between them. This flexible architecture enables you to deploy computation to
one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without
rewriting code. TensorFlow also includes
TensorBoard, a data visualization
toolkit.
TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers
working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research
organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural
networks research.  The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide
variety of other domains, as well.
TensorFlow provides stable Python and C APIs as well as non-guaranteed backwards
compatible API's for C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Swift.
Keep up to date with release announcements and security updates by
subscribing to
announce@tensorflow.org.
Installation
To install the current release for CPU-only:
pip install tensorflow

Use the GPU package for CUDA-enabled GPU cards:

Types



1.1 Primitives: When you access a primitive type you work directly on its value.

string
number
boolean
null
undefined
symbol

const foo = 1;
let bar = foo;

bar = 9;

console.log(foo, bar); // => 1, 9

Symbols cannot be faithfully polyfilled, so they should not be used when targeting browsers/environments that don’t support them natively.






1.2 Complex: When you access a complex type you work on a reference to its value.

object
array
function

const foo = [1, 2];
const bar = foo;

bar[0] = 9;

console.log(foo[0], bar[0]); // => 9, 9


⬆ back to top
References



2.1 Use const for all of your references; avoid using var. eslint: prefer-const, no-const-assign

Why? This ensures that you can’t reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.

// bad
var a = 1;
var b = 2;

// good
const a = 1;
const b = 2;





2.2 If you must reassign references, use let instead of var. eslint: no-var

Why? let is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like var.

// bad
var count = 1;
if (true) {
  count += 1;
}

// good, use the let.
let count = 1;
if (true) {
  count += 1;
}





2.3 Note that both let and const are block-scoped.
// const and let only exist in the blocks they are defined in.
{
  let a = 1;
  const b = 1;
}
console.log(a); // ReferenceError
console.log(b); // ReferenceError


⬆ back to top
Objects



3.1 Use the literal syntax for object creation. eslint: no-new-object
// bad
const item = new Object();

// good
const item = {};





3.2 Use computed property names when creating objects with dynamic property names.

Why? They allow you to define all the properties of an object in one place.

function getKey(k) {
  return `a key named ${k}`;
}

// bad
const obj = {
  id: 5,
  name: 'San Francisco',
};
obj[getKey('enabled')] = true;

// good
const obj = {
  id: 5,
  name: 'San Francisco',
  [getKey('enabled')]: true,
};





3.3 Use object method shorthand. eslint: object-shorthand
// bad
const atom = {
  value: 1,

  addValue: function (value) {
    return atom.value + value;
  },
};

// good
const atom = {
  value: 1,

  addValue(value) {
    return atom.value + value;
  },
};





3.4 Use property value shorthand. eslint: object-shorthand

Why? It is shorter and descriptive.

const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';

// bad
const obj = {
  lukeSkywalker: lukeSkywalker,
};

// good
const obj = {
  lukeSkywalker,
};





3.5 Group your shorthand properties at the beginning of your object declaration.

Why? It’s easier to tell which properties are using the shorthand.

const anakinSkywalker = 'Anakin Skywalker';
const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';

// bad
const obj = {
  episodeOne: 1,
  twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,
  lukeSkywalker,
  episodeThree: 3,
  mayTheFourth: 4,
  anakinSkywalker,
};

// good
const obj = {
  lukeSkywalker,
  anakinSkywalker,
  episodeOne: 1,
  twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,
  episodeThree: 3,
  mayTheFourth: 4,
};





3.6 Only quote properties that are invalid identifiers. eslint: quote-props

Why? In general we consider it subjectively easier to read. It improves syntax highlighting, and is also more easily optimized by many JS engines.

// bad
const bad = {
  'foo': 3,
  'bar': 4,
  'data-blah': 5,
};

// good
const good = {
  foo: 3,
  bar: 4,
  'data-blah': 5,
};





3.7 Do not call Object.prototype methods directly, such as hasOwnProperty, propertyIsEnumerable, and isPrototypeOf. eslint: no-prototype-builtins

Why? These methods may be shadowed by properties on the object in question - consider { hasOwnProperty: false } - or, the object may be a null object (Object.create(null)).

// bad
console.log(object.hasOwnProperty(key));

// good
console.log(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, key));

// best
const has = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty; // cache the lookup once, in module scope.
/* or */
import has from 'has'; // https://www.npmjs.com/package/has
// ...
console.log(has.call(object, key));





3.8 Prefer the object spread operator over Object.assign to shallow-copy objects. Use the object rest operator to get a new object with certain properties omitted.
// very bad
const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const copy = Object.assign(original, { c: 3 }); // this mutates `original` ಠ_ಠ
delete copy.a; // so does this

// bad
const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const copy = Object.assign({}, original, { c: 3 }); // copy => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

// good
const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const copy = { ...original, c: 3 }; // copy => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

const { a, ...noA } = copy; // noA => { b: 2, c: 3 }

Arrays



4.1 Use the literal syntax for array creation. eslint: no-array-constructor
// bad
const items = new Array();

// good
const items = [];





4.2 Use Array#push instead of direct assignment to add items to an array.
const someStack = [];

// bad
someStack[someStack.length] = 'abracadabra';

// good
someStack.push('abracadabra');





4.3 Use array spreads ... to copy arrays.
// bad
const len = items.length;
const itemsCopy = [];
let i;

for (i = 0; i < len; i += 1) {
  itemsCopy[i] = items[i];
}

// good
const itemsCopy = [...items];






4.4 To convert an iterable object to an array, use spreads ... instead of Array.from.
const foo = document.querySelectorAll('.foo');

// good
const nodes = Array.from(foo);

// best
const nodes = [...foo];





4.5 Use Array.from for converting an array-like object to an array.
const arrLike = { 0: 'foo', 1: 'bar', 2: 'baz', length: 3 };

// bad
const arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(arrLike);

// good
const arr = Array.from(arrLike);





4.6 Use Array.from instead of spread ... for mapping over iterables, because it avoids creating an intermediate array.
// bad
const baz = [...foo].map(bar);

// good
const baz = Array.from(foo, bar);





4.7 Use return statements in array method callbacks. It’s ok to omit the return if the function body consists of a single statement returning an expression without side effects, following 8.2. eslint: array-callback-return
// good
[1, 2, 3].map((x) => {
  const y = x + 1;
  return x * y;
});

// good
[1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1);

// bad - no returned value means `acc` becomes undefined after the first iteration
[[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((acc, item, index) => {
  const flatten = acc.concat(item);
});

// good
[[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((acc, item, index) => {
  const flatten = acc.concat(item);
  return flatten;
});

// bad
inbox.filter((msg) => {
  const { subject, author } = msg;
  if (subject === 'Mockingbird') {
    return author === 'Harper Lee';
  } else {
    return false;
  }
});

// good
inbox.filter((msg) => {
  const { subject, author } = msg;
  if (subject === 'Mockingbird') {
    return author === 'Harper Lee';
  }

  return false;
});





4.8 Use line breaks after open and before close array brackets if an array has multiple lines
// bad
const arr = [
  [0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5],
];

const objectInArray = [{
  id: 1,
}, {
  id: 2,
}];

const numberInArray = [
  1, 2,
];

// good
const arr = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]];

const objectInArray = [
  {
    id: 1,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
  },
];

const numberInArray = [
  1,
  2,
];

Destructuring



5.1 Use object destructuring when accessing and using multiple properties of an object. eslint: prefer-destructuring

Why? Destructuring saves you from creating temporary references for those properties.

// bad
function getFullName(user) {
  const firstName = user.firstName;
  const lastName = user.lastName;

  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
}

// good
function getFullName(user) {
  const { firstName, lastName } = user;
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
}

// best
function getFullName({ firstName, lastName }) {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
}





5.2 Use array destructuring. eslint: prefer-destructuring
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// bad
const first = arr[0];
const second = arr[1];

// good
const [first, second] = arr;





5.3 Use object destructuring for multiple return values, not array destructuring.

Why? You can add new properties over time or change the order of things without breaking call sites.

// bad
function processInput(input) {
  // then a miracle occurs
  return [left, right, top, bottom];
}

// the caller needs to think about the order of return data
const [left, __, top] = processInput(input);

// good
function processInput(input) {
  // then a miracle occurs
  return { left, right, top, bottom };
}

// the caller selects only the data they need
const { left, top } = processInput(input);


⬆ back to top
Strings



6.1 Use single quotes '' for strings. eslint: quotes
// bad
const name = ""Capt. Janeway"";

// bad - template literals should contain interpolation or newlines
const name = `Capt. Janeway`;

// good
const name = 'Capt. Janeway';





6.2 Strings that cause the line to go over 100 characters should not be written across multiple lines using string concatenation.

Why? Broken strings are painful to work with and make code less searchable.

// bad
const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because \
of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do \
with this, you would get nowhere \
fast.';

// bad
const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because ' +
  'of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do ' +
  'with this, you would get nowhere fast.';

// good
const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do with this, you would get nowhere fast.';





6.3 When programmatically building up strings, use template strings instead of concatenation. eslint: prefer-template template-curly-spacing

Why? Template strings give you a readable, concise syntax with proper newlines and string interpolation features.

// bad
function sayHi(name) {
  return 'How are you, ' + name + '?';
}

// bad
function sayHi(name) {
  return ['How are you, ', name, '?'].join();
}

// bad
function sayHi(name) {
  return `How are you, ${ name }?`;
}

// good
function sayHi(name) {
  return `How are you, ${name}?`;
}




6.4 Never use eval() on a string, it opens too many vulnerabilities. eslint: no-eval




6.5 Do not unnecessarily escape characters in strings. eslint: no-useless-escape

Why? Backslashes harm readability, thus they should only be present when necessary.

// bad
const foo = '\'this\' \i\s \""quoted\""';

// good
const foo = '\'this\' is ""quoted""';
const foo = `my name is '${name}'`;


⬆ back to top
Functions



7.1 Use named function expressions instead of function declarations. eslint: func-style

Why? Function declarations are hoisted, which means that it’s easy - too easy - to reference the function before it is defined in the file. This harms readability and maintainability. If you find that a function’s definition is large or complex enough that it is interfering with understanding the rest of the file, then perhaps it’s time to extract it to its own module! Don’t forget to explicitly name the expression, regardless of whether or not the name is inferred from the containing variable (which is often the case in modern browsers or when using compilers such as Babel). This eliminates any assumptions made about the Error’s call stack. (Discussion)

// bad
function foo() {
  // ...
}

// bad
const foo = function () {
  // ...
};

// good
// lexical name distinguished from the variable-referenced invocation(s)
const short = function longUniqueMoreDescriptiveLexicalFoo() {
  // ...
};





7.2 Wrap immediately invoked function expressions in parentheses. eslint: wrap-iife

Why? An immediately invoked function expression is a single unit - wrapping both it, and its invocation parens, in parens, cleanly expresses this. Note that in a world with modules everywhere, you almost never need an IIFE.

// immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE)
(function () {
  console.log('Welcome to the Internet. Please follow me.');
}());




7.3 Never declare a function in a non-function block (if, while, etc). Assign the function to a variable instead. Browsers will allow you to do it, but they all interpret it differently, which is bad news bears. eslint: no-loop-func




7.4 Note: ECMA-262 defines a block as a list of statements. A function declaration is not a statement.
// bad
if (currentUser) {
  function test() {
    console.log('Nope.');
  }
}

// good
let test;
if (currentUser) {
  test = () => {
    console.log('Yup.');
  };
}





7.5 Never name a parameter arguments. This will take precedence over the arguments object that is given to every function scope.
// bad
function foo(name, options, arguments) {
  // ...
}

// good
function foo(name, options, args) {
  // ...
}





7.6 Never use arguments, opt to use rest syntax ... instead. eslint: prefer-rest-params

Why? ... is explicit about which arguments you want pulled. Plus, rest arguments are a real Array, and not merely Array-like like arguments.

// bad
function concatenateAll() {
  const args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
  return args.join('');
}

// good
function concatenateAll(...args) {
  return args.join('');
}





7.7 Use default parameter syntax rather than mutating function arguments.
// really bad
function handleThings(opts) {
  // No! We shouldn’t mutate function arguments.
  // Double bad: if opts is falsy it'll be set to an object which may
  // be what you want but it can introduce subtle bugs.
  opts = opts || {};
  // ...
}

// still bad
function handleThings(opts) {
  if (opts === void 0) {
    opts = {};
  }
  // ...
}

// good
function handleThings(opts = {}) {
  // ...
}





7.8 Avoid side effects with default parameters.

Why? They are confusing to reason about.

var b = 1;
// bad
function count(a = b++) {
  console.log(a);
}
count();  // 1
count();  // 2
count(3); // 3
count();  // 3





7.9 Always put default parameters last.
// bad
function handleThings(opts = {}, name) {
  // ...
}

// good
function handleThings(name, opts = {}) {
  // ...
}





7.10 Never use the Function constructor to create a new function. eslint: no-new-func

Why? Creating a function in this way evaluates a string similarly to eval(), which opens vulnerabilities.

// bad
var add = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');

// still bad
var subtract = Function('a', 'b', 'return a - b');





7.11 Spacing in a function signature. eslint: space-before-function-paren space-before-blocks

Why? Consistency is good, and you shouldn’t have to add or remove a space when adding or removing a name.

// bad
const f = function(){};
const g = function (){};
const h = function() {};

// good
const x = function () {};
const y = function a() {};





7.12 Never mutate parameters. eslint: no-param-reassign

Why? Manipulating objects passed in as parameters can cause unwanted variable side effects in the original caller.

// bad
function f1(obj) {
  obj.key = 1;
}

// good
function f2(obj) {
  const key = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, 'key') ? obj.key : 1;
}





7.13 Never reassign parameters. eslint: no-param-reassign

Why? Reassigning parameters can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when accessing the arguments object. It can also cause optimization issues, especially in V8.

// bad
function f1(a) {
  a = 1;
  // ...
}

function f2(a) {
  if (!a) { a = 1; }
  // ...
}

// good
function f3(a) {
  const b = a || 1;
  // ...
}

function f4(a = 1) {
  // ...
}





7.14 Prefer the use of the spread operator ... to call variadic functions. eslint: prefer-spread

Why? It’s cleaner, you don’t need to supply a context, and you can not easily compose new with apply.

// bad
const x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log.apply(console, x);

// good
const x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(...x);

// bad
new (Function.prototype.bind.apply(Date, [null, 2016, 8, 5]));

// good
new Date(...[2016, 8, 5]);





7.15 Functions with multiline signatures, or invocations, should be indented just like every other multiline list in this guide: with each item on a line by itself, with a trailing comma on the last item. eslint: function-paren-newline
// bad
function foo(bar,
             baz,
             quux) {
  // ...
}

// good
function foo(
  bar,
  baz,
  quux,
) {
  // ...
}

// bad
console.log(foo,
  bar,
  baz);

// good
console.log(
  foo,
  bar,
  baz,
);


⬆ back to top
Arrow Functions



8.1 When you must use an anonymous function (as when passing an inline callback), use arrow function notation. eslint: prefer-arrow-callback, arrow-spacing

Why? It creates a version of the function that executes in the context of this, which is usually what you want, and is a more concise syntax.


Why not? If you have a fairly complicated function, you might move that logic out into its own named function expression.

// bad
[1, 2, 3].map(function (x) {
  const y = x + 1;
  return x * y;
});

// good
[1, 2, 3].map((x) => {
  const y = x + 1;
  return x * y;
});





8.2 If the function body consists of a single statement returning an expression without side effects, omit the braces and use the implicit return. Otherwise, keep the braces and use a return statement. eslint: arrow-parens, arrow-body-style

Why? Syntactic sugar. It reads well when multiple functions are chained together.

// bad
[1, 2, 3].map(number => {
  const nextNumber = number + 1;
  `A string containing the ${nextNumber}.`;
});

// good
[1, 2, 3].map(number => `A string containing the ${number + 1}.`);

// good
[1, 2, 3].map((number) => {
  const nextNumber = number + 1;
  return `A string containing the ${nextNumber}.`;
});

// good
[1, 2, 3].map((number, index) => ({
  [index]: number,
}));

// No implicit return with side effects
function foo(callback) {
  const val = callback();
  if (val === true) {
    // Do something if callback returns true
  }
}

let bool = false;

// bad
foo(() => bool = true);

// good
foo(() => {
  bool = true;
});





8.3 In case the expression spans over multiple lines, wrap it in parentheses for better readability.

Why? It shows clearly where the function starts and ends.

// bad
['get', 'post', 'put'].map(httpMethod => Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(
    httpMagicObjectWithAVeryLongName,
    httpMethod,
  )
);

// good
['get', 'post', 'put'].map(httpMethod => (
  Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(
    httpMagicObjectWithAVeryLongName,
    httpMethod,
  )
));





8.4 If your function takes a single argument and doesn’t use braces, omit the parentheses. Otherwise, always include parentheses around arguments for clarity and consistency. Note: it is also acceptable to always use parentheses, in which case use the “always” option for eslint. eslint: arrow-parens

Why? Less visual clutter.

// bad
[1, 2, 3].map((x) => x * x);

// good
[1, 2, 3].map(x => x * x);

// good
[1, 2, 3].map(number => (
  `A long string with the ${number}. It’s so long that we don’t want it to take up space on the .map line!`
));

// bad
[1, 2, 3].map(x => {
  const y = x + 1;
  return x * y;
});

// good
[1, 2, 3].map((x) => {
  const y = x + 1;
  return x * y;
});





8.5 Avoid confusing arrow function syntax (=>) with comparison operators (<=, >=). eslint: no-confusing-arrow
// bad
const itemHeight = item => item.height <= 256 ? item.largeSize : item.smallSize;

// bad
const itemHeight = (item) => item.height >= 256 ? item.largeSize : item.smallSize;

// good
const itemHeight = item => (item.height <= 256 ? item.largeSize : item.smallSize);

// good
const itemHeight = (item) => {
  const { height, largeSize, smallSize } = item;
  return height <= 256 ? largeSize : smallSize;
};





8.6 Enforce the location of arrow function bodies with implicit returns. eslint: implicit-arrow-linebreak
// bad
foo =>
  bar;

foo =>
  (bar);

// good
foo => bar;
foo => (bar);
foo => (
   bar
)

Classes & Constructors



9.1 Always use class. Avoid manipulating prototype directly.

Why? class syntax is more concise and easier to reason about.

// bad
function Queue(contents = []) {
  this.queue = [...contents];
}
Queue.prototype.pop = function () {
  const value = this.queue[0];
  this.queue.splice(0, 1);
  return value;
};

// good
class Queue {
  constructor(contents = []) {
    this.queue = [...contents];
  }
  pop() {
    const value = this.queue[0];
    this.queue.splice(0, 1);
    return value;
  }
}





9.2 Use extends for inheritance.

Why? It is a built-in way to inherit prototype functionality without breaking instanceof.

// bad
const inherits = require('inherits');
function PeekableQueue(contents) {
  Queue.apply(this, contents);
}
inherits(PeekableQueue, Queue);
PeekableQueue.prototype.peek = function () {
  return this.queue[0];
};

// good
class PeekableQueue extends Queue {
  peek() {
    return this.queue[0];
  }
}





9.3 Methods can return this to help with method chaining.
// bad
Jedi.prototype.jump = function () {
  this.jumping = true;
  return true;
};

Jedi.prototype.setHeight = function (height) {
  this.height = height;
};

const luke = new Jedi();
luke.jump(); // => true
luke.setHeight(20); // => undefined

// good
class Jedi {
  jump() {
    this.jumping = true;
    return this;
  }

  setHeight(height) {
    this.height = height;
    return this;
  }
}

const luke = new Jedi();

luke.jump()
  .setHeight(20);





9.4 It’s okay to write a custom toString() method, just make sure it works successfully and causes no side effects.
class Jedi {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.name = options.name || 'no name';
  }

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  toString() {
    return `Jedi - ${this.getName()}`;
  }
}





9.5 Classes have a default constructor if one is not specified. An empty constructor function or one that just delegates to a parent class is unnecessary. eslint: no-useless-constructor
// bad
class Jedi {
  constructor() {}

  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

// bad
class Rey extends Jedi {
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);
  }
}

// good
class Rey extends Jedi {
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);
    this.name = 'Rey';
  }
}





9.6 Avoid duplicate class members. eslint: no-dupe-class-members

Why? Duplicate class member declarations will silently prefer the last one - having duplicates is almost certainly a bug.

// bad
class Foo {
  bar() { return 1; }
  bar() { return 2; }
}

// good
class Foo {
  bar() { return 1; }
}

// good
class Foo {
  bar() { return 2; }
}


⬆ back to top
Modules



10.1 Always use modules (import/export) over a non-standard module system. You can always transpile to your preferred module system.

Why? Modules are the future, let’s start using the future now.

// bad
const AirbnbStyleGuide = require('./AirbnbStyleGuide');
module.exports = AirbnbStyleGuide.es6;

// ok
import AirbnbStyleGuide from './AirbnbStyleGuide';
export default AirbnbStyleGuide.es6;

// best
import { es6 } from './AirbnbStyleGuide';
export default es6;





10.2 Do not use wildcard imports.

Why? This makes sure you have a single default export.

// bad
import * as AirbnbStyleGuide from './AirbnbStyleGuide';

// good
import AirbnbStyleGuide from './AirbnbStyleGuide';





10.3 And do not export directly from an import.

Why? Although the one-liner is concise, having one clear way to import and one clear way to export makes things consistent.

// bad
// filename es6.js
export { es6 as default } from './AirbnbStyleGuide';

// good
// filename es6.js
import { es6 } from './AirbnbStyleGuide';
export default es6;





10.4 Only import from a path in one place.
eslint: no-duplicate-imports

Why? Having multiple lines that import from the same path can make code harder to maintain.

// bad
import foo from 'foo';
// … some other imports … //
import { named1, named2 } from 'foo';

// good
import foo, { named1, named2 } from 'foo';

// good
import foo, {
  named1,
  named2,
} from 'foo';





10.5 Do not export mutable bindings.
eslint: import/no-mutable-exports

Why? Mutation should be avoided in general, but in particular when exporting mutable bindings. While this technique may be needed for some special cases, in general, only constant references should be exported.

// bad
let foo = 3;
export { foo };

// good
const foo = 3;
export { foo };





10.6 In modules with a single export, prefer default export over named export.
eslint: import/prefer-default-export

Why? To encourage more files that only ever export one thing, which is better for readability and maintainability.

// bad
export function foo() {}

// good
export default function foo() {}





10.7 Put all imports above non-import statements.
eslint: import/first

Why? Since imports are hoisted, keeping them all at the top prevents surprising behavior.

// bad
import foo from 'foo';
foo.init();

import bar from 'bar';

// good
import foo from 'foo';
import bar from 'bar';

foo.init();





10.8 Multiline imports should be indented just like multiline array and object literals.

Why? The curly braces follow the same indentation rules as every other curly brace block in the style guide, as do the trailing commas.

// bad
import {longNameA, longNameB, longNameC, longNameD, longNameE} from 'path';

// good
import {
  longNameA,
  longNameB,
  longNameC,
  longNameD,
  longNameE,
} from 'path';





10.9 Disallow Webpack loader syntax in module import statements.
eslint: import/no-webpack-loader-syntax

Why? Since using Webpack syntax in the imports couples the code to a module bundler. Prefer using the loader syntax in webpack.config.js.

// bad
import fooSass from 'css!sass!foo.scss';
import barCss from 'style!css!bar.css';

// good
import fooSass from 'foo.scss';
import barCss from 'bar.css';

Iterators and Generators



11.1 Don’t use iterators. Prefer JavaScript’s higher-order functions instead of loops like for-in or for-of. eslint: no-iterator no-restricted-syntax

Why? This enforces our immutable rule. Dealing with pure functions that return values is easier to reason about than side effects.


Use map() / every() / filter() / find() / findIndex() / reduce() / some() / ... to iterate over arrays, and Object.keys() / Object.values() / Object.entries() to produce arrays so you can iterate over objects.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// bad
let sum = 0;
for (let num of numbers) {
  sum += num;
}
sum === 15;

// good
let sum = 0;
numbers.forEach((num) => {
  sum += num;
});
sum === 15;

// best (use the functional force)
const sum = numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
sum === 15;

// bad
const increasedByOne = [];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  increasedByOne.push(numbers[i] + 1);
}

// good
const increasedByOne = [];
numbers.forEach((num) => {
  increasedByOne.push(num + 1);
});

// best (keeping it functional)
const increasedByOne = numbers.map(num => num + 1);





11.2 Don’t use generators for now.

Why? They don’t transpile well to ES5.






11.3 If you must use generators, or if you disregard our advice, make sure their function signature is spaced properly. eslint: generator-star-spacing

Why? function and * are part of the same conceptual keyword - * is not a modifier for function, function* is a unique construct, different from function.

// bad
function * foo() {
  // ...
}

// bad
const bar = function * () {
  // ...
};

// bad
const baz = function *() {
  // ...
};

// bad
const quux = function*() {
  // ...
};

// bad
function*foo() {
  // ...
}

// bad
function *foo() {
  // ...
}

// very bad
function
*
foo() {
  // ...
}

// very bad
const wat = function
*
() {
  // ...
};

// good
function* foo() {
  // ...
}

// good
const foo = function* () {
  // ...
};

Properties



12.1 Use dot notation when accessing properties. eslint: dot-notation
const luke = {
  jedi: true,
  age: 28,
};

// bad
const isJedi = luke['jedi'];

// good
const isJedi = luke.jedi;





12.2 Use bracket notation [] when accessing properties with a variable.
const luke = {
  jedi: true,
  age: 28,
};

function getProp(prop) {
  return luke[prop];
}

const isJedi = getProp('jedi');





12.3 Use exponentiation operator ** when calculating exponentiations. eslint: no-restricted-properties.
// bad
const binary = Math.pow(2, 10);

// good
const binary = 2 ** 10;


⬆ back to top
Variables



13.1 Always use const or let to declare variables. Not doing so will result in global variables. We want to avoid polluting the global namespace. Captain Planet warned us of that. eslint: no-undef prefer-const
// bad
superPower = new SuperPower();

// good
const superPower = new SuperPower();





13.2 Use one const or let declaration per variable or assignment. eslint: one-var

Why? It’s easier to add new variable declarations this way, and you never have to worry about swapping out a ; for a , or introducing punctuation-only diffs. You can also step through each declaration with the debugger, instead of jumping through all of them at once.

// bad
const items = getItems(),
    goSportsTeam = true,
    dragonball = 'z';

// bad
// (compare to above, and try to spot the mistake)
const items = getItems(),
    goSportsTeam = true;
    dragonball = 'z';

// good
const items = getItems();
const goSportsTeam = true;
const dragonball = 'z';





13.3 Group all your consts and then group all your lets.

Why? This is helpful when later on you might need to assign a variable depending on one of the previous assigned variables.

// bad
let i, len, dragonball,
    items = getItems(),
    goSportsTeam = true;

// bad
let i;
const items = getItems();
let dragonball;
const goSportsTeam = true;
let len;

// good
const goSportsTeam = true;
const items = getItems();
let dragonball;
let i;
let length;





13.4 Assign variables where you need them, but place them in a reasonable place.

Why? let and const are block scoped and not function scoped.

// bad - unnecessary function call
function checkName(hasName) {
  const name = getName();

  if (hasName === 'test') {
    return false;
  }

  if (name === 'test') {
    this.setName('');
    return false;
  }

  return name;
}

// good
function checkName(hasName) {
  if (hasName === 'test') {
    return false;
  }

  const name = getName();

  if (name === 'test') {
    this.setName('');
    return false;
  }

  return name;
}





13.5 Don’t chain variable assignments. eslint: no-multi-assign

Why? Chaining variable assignments creates implicit global variables.

// bad
(function example() {
  // JavaScript interprets this as
  // let a = ( b = ( c = 1 ) );
  // The let keyword only applies to variable a; variables b and c become
  // global variables.
  let a = b = c = 1;
}());

console.log(a); // throws ReferenceError
console.log(b); // 1
console.log(c); // 1

// good
(function example() {
  let a = 1;
  let b = a;
  let c = a;
}());

console.log(a); // throws ReferenceError
console.log(b); // throws ReferenceError
console.log(c); // throws ReferenceError

// the same applies for `const`





13.6 Avoid using unary increments and decrements (++, --). eslint no-plusplus

Why? Per the eslint documentation, unary increment and decrement statements are subject to automatic semicolon insertion and can cause silent errors with incrementing or decrementing values within an application. It is also more expressive to mutate your values with statements like num += 1 instead of num++ or num ++. Disallowing unary increment and decrement statements also prevents you from pre-incrementing/pre-decrementing values unintentionally which can also cause unexpected behavior in your programs.

// bad

const array = [1, 2, 3];
let num = 1;
num++;
--num;

let sum = 0;
let truthyCount = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  let value = array[i];
  sum += value;
  if (value) {
    truthyCount++;
  }
}

// good

const array = [1, 2, 3];
let num = 1;
num += 1;
num -= 1;

const sum = array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
const truthyCount = array.filter(Boolean).length;





13.7 Avoid linebreaks before or after = in an assignment. If your assignment violates max-len, surround the value in parens. eslint operator-linebreak.

Why? Linebreaks surrounding = can obfuscate the value of an assignment.

// bad
const foo =
  superLongLongLongLongLongLongLongLongFunctionName();

// bad
const foo
  = 'superLongLongLongLongLongLongLongLongString';

// good
const foo = (
  superLongLongLongLongLongLongLongLongFunctionName()
);

// good
const foo = 'superLongLongLongLongLongLongLongLongString';





13.8 Disallow unused variables. eslint: no-unused-vars

Why? Variables that are declared and not used anywhere in the code are most likely an error due to incomplete refactoring. Such variables take up space in the code and can lead to confusion by readers.

// bad

var some_unused_var = 42;

// Write-only variables are not considered as used.
var y = 10;
y = 5;

// A read for a modification of itself is not considered as used.
var z = 0;
z = z + 1;

// Unused function arguments.
function getX(x, y) {
    return x;
}

// good

function getXPlusY(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

var x = 1;
var y = a + 2;

alert(getXPlusY(x, y));

// 'type' is ignored even if unused because it has a rest property sibling.
// This is a form of extracting an object that omits the specified keys.
var { type, ...coords } = data;
// 'coords' is now the 'data' object without its 'type' property.

Hoisting



14.1 var declarations get hoisted to the top of their closest enclosing function scope, their assignment does not. const and let declarations are blessed with a new concept called Temporal Dead Zones (TDZ). It’s important to know why typeof is no longer safe.
// we know this wouldn’t work (assuming there
// is no notDefined global variable)
function example() {
  console.log(notDefined); // => throws a ReferenceError
}

// creating a variable declaration after you
// reference the variable will work due to
// variable hoisting. Note: the assignment
// value of `true` is not hoisted.
function example() {
  console.log(declaredButNotAssigned); // => undefined
  var declaredButNotAssigned = true;
}

// the interpreter is hoisting the variable
// declaration to the top of the scope,
// which means our example could be rewritten as:
function example() {
  let declaredButNotAssigned;
  console.log(declaredButNotAssigned); // => undefined
  declaredButNotAssigned = true;
}

// using const and let
function example() {
  console.log(declaredButNotAssigned); // => throws a ReferenceError
  console.log(typeof declaredButNotAssigned); // => throws a ReferenceError
  const declaredButNotAssigned = true;
}





14.2 Anonymous function expressions hoist their variable name, but not the function assignment.
function example() {
  console.log(anonymous); // => undefined

  anonymous(); // => TypeError anonymous is not a function

  var anonymous = function () {
    console.log('anonymous function expression');
  };
}





14.3 Named function expressions hoist the variable name, not the function name or the function body.
function example() {
  console.log(named); // => undefined

  named(); // => TypeError named is not a function

  superPower(); // => ReferenceError superPower is not defined

  var named = function superPower() {
    console.log('Flying');
  };
}

// the same is true when the function name
// is the same as the variable name.
function example() {
  console.log(named); // => undefined

  named(); // => TypeError named is not a function

  var named = function named() {
    console.log('named');
  };
}





14.4 Function declarations hoist their name and the function body.
function example() {
  superPower(); // => Flying

  function superPower() {
    console.log('Flying');
  }
}

Comparison Operators & Equality


15.1 Use === and !== over == and !=. eslint: eqeqeq




15.2 Conditional statements such as the if statement evaluate their expression using coercion with the ToBoolean abstract method and always follow these simple rules:

Objects evaluate to true
Undefined evaluates to false
Null evaluates to false
Booleans evaluate to the value of the boolean
Numbers evaluate to false if +0, -0, or NaN, otherwise true
Strings evaluate to false if an empty string '', otherwise true

if ([0] && []) {
  // true
  // an array (even an empty one) is an object, objects will evaluate to true
}





15.3 Use shortcuts for booleans, but explicit comparisons for strings and numbers.
// bad
if (isValid === true) {
  // ...
}

// good
if (isValid) {
  // ...
}

// bad
if (name) {
  // ...
}

// good
if (name !== '') {
  // ...
}

// bad
if (collection.length) {
  // ...
}

// good
if (collection.length > 0) {
  // ...
}




15.4 For more information see Truth Equality and JavaScript by Angus Croll.




15.5 Use braces to create blocks in case and default clauses that contain lexical declarations (e.g. let, const, function, and class). eslint: no-case-declarations

Why? Lexical declarations are visible in the entire switch block but only get initialized when assigned, which only happens when its case is reached. This causes problems when multiple case clauses attempt to define the same thing.

// bad
switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    let x = 1;
    break;
  case 2:
    const y = 2;
    break;
  case 3:
    function f() {
      // ...
    }
    break;
  default:
    class C {}
}

// good
switch (foo) {
  case 1: {
    let x = 1;
    break;
  }
  case 2: {
    const y = 2;
    break;
  }
  case 3: {
    function f() {
      // ...
    }
    break;
  }
  case 4:
    bar();
    break;
  default: {
    class C {}
  }
}





15.6 Ternaries should not be nested and generally be single line expressions. eslint: no-nested-ternary
// bad
const foo = maybe1 > maybe2
  ? ""bar""
  : value1 > value2 ? ""baz"" : null;

// split into 2 separated ternary expressions
const maybeNull = value1 > value2 ? 'baz' : null;

// better
const foo = maybe1 > maybe2
  ? 'bar'
  : maybeNull;

// best
const foo = maybe1 > maybe2 ? 'bar' : maybeNull;





15.7 Avoid unneeded ternary statements. eslint: no-unneeded-ternary
// bad
const foo = a ? a : b;
const bar = c ? true : false;
const baz = c ? false : true;

// good
const foo = a || b;
const bar = !!c;
const baz = !c;





15.8 When mixing operators, enclose them in parentheses. The only exception is the standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, & /) since their precedence is broadly understood. eslint: no-mixed-operators

Why? This improves readability and clarifies the developer’s intention.

// bad
const foo = a && b < 0 || c > 0 || d + 1 === 0;

// bad
const bar = a ** b - 5 % d;

// bad
// one may be confused into thinking (a || b) && c
if (a || b && c) {
  return d;
}

// good
const foo = (a && b < 0) || c > 0 || (d + 1 === 0);

// good
const bar = (a ** b) - (5 % d);

// good
if (a || (b && c)) {
  return d;
}

// good
const bar = a + b / c * d;

Blocks



16.1 Use braces with all multi-line blocks. eslint: nonblock-statement-body-position
// bad
if (test)
  return false;

// good
if (test) return false;

// good
if (test) {
  return false;
}

// bad
function foo() { return false; }

// good
function bar() {
  return false;
}





16.2 If you’re using multi-line blocks with if and else, put else on the same line as your if block’s closing brace. eslint: brace-style
// bad
if (test) {
  thing1();
  thing2();
}
else {
  thing3();
}

// good
if (test) {
  thing1();
  thing2();
} else {
  thing3();
}





16.3 If an if block always executes a return statement, the subsequent else block is unnecessary. A return in an else if block following an if block that contains a return can be separated into multiple if blocks. eslint: no-else-return
// bad
function foo() {
  if (x) {
    return x;
  } else {
    return y;
  }
}

// bad
function cats() {
  if (x) {
    return x;
  } else if (y) {
    return y;
  }
}

// bad
function dogs() {
  if (x) {
    return x;
  } else {
    if (y) {
      return y;
    }
  }
}

// good
function foo() {
  if (x) {
    return x;
  }

  return y;
}

// good
function cats() {
  if (x) {
    return x;
  }

  if (y) {
    return y;
  }
}

// good
function dogs(x) {
  if (x) {
    if (z) {
      return y;
    }
  } else {
    return z;
  }
}

Control Statements



17.1 In case your control statement (if, while etc.) gets too long or exceeds the maximum line length, each (grouped) condition could be put into a new line. The logical operator should begin the line.

Why? Requiring operators at the beginning of the line keeps the operators aligned and follows a pattern similar to method chaining. This also improves readability by making it easier to visually follow complex logic.

// bad
if ((foo === 123 || bar === 'abc') && doesItLookGoodWhenItBecomesThatLong() && isThisReallyHappening()) {
  thing1();
}

// bad
if (foo === 123 &&
  bar === 'abc') {
  thing1();
}

// bad
if (foo === 123
  && bar === 'abc') {
  thing1();
}

// bad
if (
  foo === 123 &&
  bar === 'abc'
) {
  thing1();
}

// good
if (
  foo === 123
  && bar === 'abc'
) {
  thing1();
}

// good
if (
  (foo === 123 || bar === 'abc')
  && doesItLookGoodWhenItBecomesThatLong()
  && isThisReallyHappening()
) {
  thing1();
}

// good
if (foo === 123 && bar === 'abc') {
  thing1();
}





17.2 Don't use selection operators in place of control statements.
// bad
!isRunning && startRunning();

// good
if (!isRunning) {
  startRunning();
}


⬆ back to top
Comments



18.1 Use /** ... */ for multi-line comments.
// bad
// make() returns a new element
// based on the passed in tag name
//
// @param {String} tag
// @return {Element} element
function make(tag) {

  // ...

  return element;
}

// good
/**
 * make() returns a new element
 * based on the passed-in tag name
 */
function make(tag) {

  // ...

  return element;
}





18.2 Use // for single line comments. Place single line comments on a newline above the subject of the comment. Put an empty line before the comment unless it’s on the first line of a block.
// bad
const active = true;  // is current tab

// good
// is current tab
const active = true;

// bad
function getType() {
  console.log('fetching type...');
  // set the default type to 'no type'
  const type = this.type || 'no type';

  return type;
}

// good
function getType() {
  console.log('fetching type...');

  // set the default type to 'no type'
  const type = this.type || 'no type';

  return type;
}

// also good
function getType() {
  // set the default type to 'no type'
  const type = this.type || 'no type';

  return type;
}





18.3 Start all comments with a space to make it easier to read. eslint: spaced-comment
// bad
//is current tab
const active = true;

// good
// is current tab
const active = true;

// bad
/**
 *make() returns a new element
 *based on the passed-in tag name
 */
function make(tag) {

  // ...

  return element;
}

// good
/**
 * make() returns a new element
 * based on the passed-in tag name
 */
function make(tag) {

  // ...

  return element;
}




18.4 Prefixing your comments with FIXME or TODO helps other developers quickly understand if you’re pointing out a problem that needs to be revisited, or if you’re suggesting a solution to the problem that needs to be implemented. These are different than regular comments because they are actionable. The actions are FIXME: -- need to figure this out or TODO: -- need to implement.




18.5 Use // FIXME: to annotate problems.
class Calculator extends Abacus {
  constructor() {
    super();

    // FIXME: shouldn’t use a global here
    total = 0;
  }
}





18.6 Use // TODO: to annotate solutions to problems.
class Calculator extends Abacus {
  constructor() {
    super();

    // TODO: total should be configurable by an options param
    this.total = 0;
  }
}

Whitespace



19.1 Use soft tabs (space character) set to 2 spaces. eslint: indent
// bad
function foo() {
∙∙∙∙let name;
}

// bad
function bar() {
∙let name;
}

// good
function baz() {
∙∙let name;
}





19.2 Place 1 space before the leading brace. eslint: space-before-blocks
// bad
function test(){
  console.log('test');
}

// good
function test() {
  console.log('test');
}

// bad
dog.set('attr',{
  age: '1 year',
  breed: 'Bernese Mountain Dog',
});

// good
dog.set('attr', {
  age: '1 year',
  breed: 'Bernese Mountain Dog',
});





19.3 Place 1 space before the opening parenthesis in control statements (if, while etc.). Place no space between the argument list and the function name in function calls and declarations. eslint: keyword-spacing
// bad
if(isJedi) {
  fight ();
}

// good
if (isJedi) {
  fight();
}

// bad
function fight () {
  console.log ('Swooosh!');
}

// good
function fight() {
  console.log('Swooosh!');
}





19.4 Set off operators with spaces. eslint: space-infix-ops
// bad
const x=y+5;

// good
const x = y + 5;





19.5 End files with a single newline character. eslint: eol-last
// bad
import { es6 } from './AirbnbStyleGuide';
  // ...
export default es6;
// bad
import { es6 } from './AirbnbStyleGuide';
  // ...
export default es6;↵
↵
// good
import { es6 } from './AirbnbStyleGuide';
  // ...
export default es6;↵





19.6 Use indentation when making long method chains (more than 2 method chains). Use a leading dot, which
emphasizes that the line is a method call, not a new statement. eslint: newline-per-chained-call no-whitespace-before-property
// bad
$('#items').find('.selected').highlight().end().find('.open').updateCount();

// bad
$('#items').
  find('.selected').
    highlight().
    end().
  find('.open').
    updateCount();

// good
$('#items')
  .find('.selected')
    .highlight()
    .end()
  .find('.open')
    .updateCount();

// bad
const leds = stage.selectAll('.led').data(data).enter().append('svg:svg').classed('led', true)
    .attr('width', (radius + margin) * 2).append('svg:g')
    .attr('transform', `translate(${radius + margin},${radius + margin})`)
    .call(tron.led);

// good
const leds = stage.selectAll('.led')
    .data(data)
  .enter().append('svg:svg')
    .classed('led', true)
    .attr('width', (radius + margin) * 2)
  .append('svg:g')
    .attr('transform', `translate(${radius + margin},${radius + margin})`)
    .call(tron.led);

// good
const leds = stage.selectAll('.led').data(data);





19.7 Leave a blank line after blocks and before the next statement.
// bad
if (foo) {
  return bar;
}
return baz;

// good
if (foo) {
  return bar;
}

return baz;

// bad
const obj = {
  foo() {
  },
  bar() {
  },
};
return obj;

// good
const obj = {
  foo() {
  },

  bar() {
  },
};

return obj;

// bad
const arr = [
  function foo() {
  },
  function bar() {
  },
];
return arr;

// good
const arr = [
  function foo() {
  },

  function bar() {
  },
];

return arr;





19.8 Do not pad your blocks with blank lines. eslint: padded-blocks
// bad
function bar() {

  console.log(foo);

}

// bad
if (baz) {

  console.log(qux);
} else {
  console.log(foo);

}

// bad
class Foo {

  constructor(bar) {
    this.bar = bar;
  }
}

// good
function bar() {
  console.log(foo);
}

// good
if (baz) {
  console.log(qux);
} else {
  console.log(foo);
}





19.9 Do not use multiple blank lines to pad your code. eslint: no-multiple-empty-lines
// bad
class Person {
  constructor(fullName, email, birthday) {
    this.fullName = fullName;


    this.email = email;


    this.setAge(birthday);
  }


  setAge(birthday) {
    const today = new Date();


    const age = this.getAge(today, birthday);


    this.age = age;
  }


  getAge(today, birthday) {
    // ..
  }
}

// good
class Person {
  constructor(fullName, email, birthday) {
    this.fullName = fullName;
    this.email = email;
    this.setAge(birthday);
  }

  setAge(birthday) {
    const today = new Date();
    const age = getAge(today, birthday);
    this.age = age;
  }

  getAge(today, birthday) {
    // ..
  }
}





19.10 Do not add spaces inside parentheses. eslint: space-in-parens
// bad
function bar( foo ) {
  return foo;
}

// good
function bar(foo) {
  return foo;
}

// bad
if ( foo ) {
  console.log(foo);
}

// good
if (foo) {
  console.log(foo);
}





19.11 Do not add spaces inside brackets. eslint: array-bracket-spacing
// bad
const foo = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
console.log(foo[ 0 ]);

// good
const foo = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(foo[0]);





19.12 Add spaces inside curly braces. eslint: object-curly-spacing
// bad
const foo = {clark: 'kent'};

// good
const foo = { clark: 'kent' };





19.13 Avoid having lines of code that are longer than 100 characters (including whitespace). Note: per above, long strings are exempt from this rule, and should not be broken up. eslint: max-len

Why? This ensures readability and maintainability.

// bad
const foo = jsonData && jsonData.foo && jsonData.foo.bar && jsonData.foo.bar.baz && jsonData.foo.bar.baz.quux && jsonData.foo.bar.baz.quux.xyzzy;

// bad
$.ajax({ method: 'POST', url: 'https://airbnb.com/', data: { name: 'John' } }).done(() => console.log('Congratulations!')).fail(() => console.log('You have failed this city.'));

// good
const foo = jsonData
  && jsonData.foo
  && jsonData.foo.bar
  && jsonData.foo.bar.baz
  && jsonData.foo.bar.baz.quux
  && jsonData.foo.bar.baz.quux.xyzzy;

// good
$.ajax({
  method: 'POST',
  url: 'https://airbnb.com/',
  data: { name: 'John' },
})
  .done(() => console.log('Congratulations!'))
  .fail(() => console.log('You have failed this city.'));





19.14 Require consistent spacing inside an open block token and the next token on the same line. This rule also enforces consistent spacing inside a close block token and previous token on the same line. eslint: block-spacing
// bad
function foo() {return true;}
if (foo) { bar = 0;}

// good
function foo() { return true; }
if (foo) { bar = 0; }





19.15 Avoid spaces before commas and require a space after commas. eslint: comma-spacing
// bad
var foo = 1,bar = 2;
var arr = [1 , 2];

// good
var foo = 1, bar = 2;
var arr = [1, 2];





19.16 Enforce spacing inside of computed property brackets. eslint: computed-property-spacing
// bad
obj[foo ]
obj[ 'foo']
var x = {[ b ]: a}
obj[foo[ bar ]]

// good
obj[foo]
obj['foo']
var x = { [b]: a }
obj[foo[bar]]





19.17 Avoid spaces between functions and their invocations. eslint: func-call-spacing
// bad
func ();

func
();

// good
func();





19.18 Enforce spacing between keys and values in object literal properties. eslint: key-spacing
// bad
var obj = { ""foo"" : 42 };
var obj2 = { ""foo"":42 };

// good
var obj = { ""foo"": 42 };




19.19 Avoid trailing spaces at the end of lines. eslint: no-trailing-spaces




19.20 Avoid multiple empty lines and only allow one newline at the end of files. eslint: no-multiple-empty-lines
// bad
var x = 1;



var y = 2;

// good
var x = 1;

var y = 2;

Commas



20.1 Leading commas: Nope. eslint: comma-style
// bad
const story = [
    once
  , upon
  , aTime
];

// good
const story = [
  once,
  upon,
  aTime,
];

// bad
const hero = {
    firstName: 'Ada'
  , lastName: 'Lovelace'
  , birthYear: 1815
  , superPower: 'computers'
};

// good
const hero = {
  firstName: 'Ada',
  lastName: 'Lovelace',
  birthYear: 1815,
  superPower: 'computers',
};





20.2 Additional trailing comma: Yup. eslint: comma-dangle

Why? This leads to cleaner git diffs. Also, transpilers like Babel will remove the additional trailing comma in the transpiled code which means you don’t have to worry about the trailing comma problem in legacy browsers.

// bad - git diff without trailing comma
const hero = {
     firstName: 'Florence',
-    lastName: 'Nightingale'
+    lastName: 'Nightingale',
+    inventorOf: ['coxcomb chart', 'modern nursing']
};

// good - git diff with trailing comma
const hero = {
     firstName: 'Florence',
     lastName: 'Nightingale',
+    inventorOf: ['coxcomb chart', 'modern nursing'],
};
// bad
const hero = {
  firstName: 'Dana',
  lastName: 'Scully'
};

Semicolons



21.1 Yup. eslint: semi

Why? When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, it uses a set of rules called Automatic Semicolon Insertion to determine whether or not it should regard that line break as the end of a statement, and (as the name implies) place a semicolon into your code before the line break if it thinks so. ASI contains a few eccentric behaviors, though, and your code will break if JavaScript misinterprets your line break. These rules will become more complicated as new features become a part of JavaScript. Explicitly terminating your statements and configuring your linter to catch missing semicolons will help prevent you from encountering issues.

// bad - raises exception
const luke = {}
const leia = {}
[luke, leia].forEach(jedi => jedi.father = 'vader')

// bad - raises exception
const reaction = ""No! That’s impossible!""
(async function meanwhileOnTheFalcon() {
  // handle `leia`, `lando`, `chewie`, `r2`, `c3p0`
  // ...
}())

// bad - returns `undefined` instead of the value on the next line - always happens when `return` is on a line by itself because of ASI!
function foo() {
  return
    'search your feelings, you know it to be foo'
}

// good
const luke = {};
const leia = {};
[luke, leia].forEach((jedi) => {
  jedi.father = 'vader';
});

// good
const reaction = ""No! That’s impossible!"";
(async function meanwhileOnTheFalcon() {
  // handle `leia`, `lando`, `chewie`, `r2`, `c3p0`
  // ...
}());

// good
function foo() {
  return 'search your feelings, you know it to be foo';
}

Type Casting & Coercion


22.1 Perform type coercion at the beginning of the statement.




22.2  Strings: eslint: no-new-wrappers
// => this.reviewScore = 9;

// bad
const totalScore = new String(this.reviewScore); // typeof totalScore is ""object"" not ""string""

// bad
const totalScore = this.reviewScore + ''; // invokes this.reviewScore.valueOf()

// bad
const totalScore = this.reviewScore.toString(); // isn’t guaranteed to return a string

// good
const totalScore = String(this.reviewScore);





22.3 Numbers: Use Number for type casting and parseInt always with a radix for parsing strings. eslint: radix no-new-wrappers
const inputValue = '4';

// bad
const val = new Number(inputValue);

// bad
const val = +inputValue;

// bad
const val = inputValue >> 0;

// bad
const val = parseInt(inputValue);

// good
const val = Number(inputValue);

// good
const val = parseInt(inputValue, 10);





22.4 If for whatever reason you are doing something wild and parseInt is your bottleneck and need to use Bitshift for performance reasons, leave a comment explaining why and what you’re doing.
// good
/**
 * parseInt was the reason my code was slow.
 * Bitshifting the String to coerce it to a
 * Number made it a lot faster.
 */
const val = inputValue >> 0;





22.5 Note: Be careful when using bitshift operations. Numbers are represented as 64-bit values, but bitshift operations always return a 32-bit integer (source). Bitshift can lead to unexpected behavior for integer values larger than 32 bits. Discussion. Largest signed 32-bit Int is 2,147,483,647:
2147483647 >> 0; // => 2147483647
2147483648 >> 0; // => -2147483648
2147483649 >> 0; // => -2147483647





22.6 Booleans: eslint: no-new-wrappers
const age = 0;

// bad
const hasAge = new Boolean(age);

// good
const hasAge = Boolean(age);

// best
const hasAge = !!age;

Naming Conventions



23.1 Avoid single letter names. Be descriptive with your naming. eslint: id-length
// bad
function q() {
  // ...
}

// good
function query() {
  // ...
}





23.2 Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances. eslint: camelcase
// bad
const OBJEcttsssss = {};
const this_is_my_object = {};
function c() {}

// good
const thisIsMyObject = {};
function thisIsMyFunction() {}





23.3 Use PascalCase only when naming constructors or classes. eslint: new-cap
// bad
function user(options) {
  this.name = options.name;
}

const bad = new user({
  name: 'nope',
});

// good
class User {
  constructor(options) {
    this.name = options.name;
  }
}

const good = new User({
  name: 'yup',
});





23.4 Do not use trailing or leading underscores. eslint: no-underscore-dangle

Why? JavaScript does not have the concept of privacy in terms of properties or methods. Although a leading underscore is a common convention to mean “private”, in fact, these properties are fully public, and as such, are part of your public API contract. This convention might lead developers to wrongly think that a change won’t count as breaking, or that tests aren’t needed. tl;dr: if you want something to be “private”, it must not be observably present.

// bad
this.__firstName__ = 'Panda';
this.firstName_ = 'Panda';
this._firstName = 'Panda';

// good
this.firstName = 'Panda';

// good, in environments where WeakMaps are available
// see https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-WeakMap
const firstNames = new WeakMap();
firstNames.set(this, 'Panda');





23.5 Don’t save references to this. Use arrow functions or Function#bind.
// bad
function foo() {
  const self = this;
  return function () {
    console.log(self);
  };
}

// bad
function foo() {
  const that = this;
  return function () {
    console.log(that);
  };
}

// good
function foo() {
  return () => {
    console.log(this);
  };
}





23.6 A base filename should exactly match the name of its default export.
// file 1 contents
class CheckBox {
  // ...
}
export default CheckBox;

// file 2 contents
export default function fortyTwo() { return 42; }

// file 3 contents
export default function insideDirectory() {}

// in some other file
// bad
import CheckBox from './checkBox'; // PascalCase import/export, camelCase filename
import FortyTwo from './FortyTwo'; // PascalCase import/filename, camelCase export
import InsideDirectory from './InsideDirectory'; // PascalCase import/filename, camelCase export

// bad
import CheckBox from './check_box'; // PascalCase import/export, snake_case filename
import forty_two from './forty_two'; // snake_case import/filename, camelCase export
import inside_directory from './inside_directory'; // snake_case import, camelCase export
import index from './inside_directory/index'; // requiring the index file explicitly
import insideDirectory from './insideDirectory/index'; // requiring the index file explicitly

// good
import CheckBox from './CheckBox'; // PascalCase export/import/filename
import fortyTwo from './fortyTwo'; // camelCase export/import/filename
import insideDirectory from './insideDirectory'; // camelCase export/import/directory name/implicit ""index""
// ^ supports both insideDirectory.js and insideDirectory/index.js





23.7 Use camelCase when you export-default a function. Your filename should be identical to your function’s name.
function makeStyleGuide() {
  // ...
}

export default makeStyleGuide;





23.8 Use PascalCase when you export a constructor / class / singleton / function library / bare object.
const AirbnbStyleGuide = {
  es6: {
  },
};

export default AirbnbStyleGuide;





23.9 Acronyms and initialisms should always be all uppercased, or all lowercased.

Why? Names are for readability, not to appease a computer algorithm.

// bad
import SmsContainer from './containers/SmsContainer';

// bad
const HttpRequests = [
  // ...
];

// good
import SMSContainer from './containers/SMSContainer';

// good
const HTTPRequests = [
  // ...
];

// also good
const httpRequests = [
  // ...
];

// best
import TextMessageContainer from './containers/TextMessageContainer';

// best
const requests = [
  // ...
];





23.10 You may optionally uppercase a constant only if it (1) is exported, (2) is a const (it can not be reassigned), and (3) the programmer can trust it (and its nested properties) to never change.

Why? This is an additional tool to assist in situations where the programmer would be unsure if a variable might ever change. UPPERCASE_VARIABLES are letting the programmer know that they can trust the variable (and its properties) not to change.


What about all const variables? - This is unnecessary, so uppercasing should not be used for constants within a file. It should be used for exported constants however.
What about exported objects? - Uppercase at the top level of export  (e.g. EXPORTED_OBJECT.key) and maintain that all nested properties do not change.

// bad
const PRIVATE_VARIABLE = 'should not be unnecessarily uppercased within a file';

// bad
export const THING_TO_BE_CHANGED = 'should obviously not be uppercased';

// bad
export let REASSIGNABLE_VARIABLE = 'do not use let with uppercase variables';

// ---

// allowed but does not supply semantic value
export const apiKey = 'SOMEKEY';

// better in most cases
export const API_KEY = 'SOMEKEY';

// ---

// bad - unnecessarily uppercases key while adding no semantic value
export const MAPPING = {
  KEY: 'value'
};

// good
export const MAPPING = {
  key: 'value'
};

Accessors


24.1 Accessor functions for properties are not required.




24.2 Do not use JavaScript getters/setters as they cause unexpected side effects and are harder to test, maintain, and reason about. Instead, if you do make accessor functions, use getVal() and setVal('hello').
// bad
class Dragon {
  get age() {
    // ...
  }

  set age(value) {
    // ...
  }
}

// good
class Dragon {
  getAge() {
    // ...
  }

  setAge(value) {
    // ...
  }
}





24.3 If the property/method is a boolean, use isVal() or hasVal().
// bad
if (!dragon.age()) {
  return false;
}

// good
if (!dragon.hasAge()) {
  return false;
}





24.4 It’s okay to create get() and set() functions, but be consistent.
class Jedi {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    const lightsaber = options.lightsaber || 'blue';
    this.set('lightsaber', lightsaber);
  }

  set(key, val) {
    this[key] = val;
  }

  get(key) {
    return this[key];
  }
}


⬆ back to top
Events



25.1 When attaching data payloads to events (whether DOM events or something more proprietary like Backbone events), pass an object literal (also known as a ""hash"")  instead of a raw value. This allows a subsequent contributor to add more data to the event payload without finding and updating every handler for the event. For example, instead of:
// bad
$(this).trigger('listingUpdated', listing.id);

// ...

$(this).on('listingUpdated', (e, listingID) => {
  // do something with listingID
});
prefer:
// good
$(this).trigger('listingUpdated', { listingID: listing.id });

// ...

$(this).on('listingUpdated', (e, data) => {
  // do something with data.listingID
});


⬆ back to top
jQuery



26.1 Prefix jQuery object variables with a $.
// bad
const sidebar = $('.sidebar');

// good
const $sidebar = $('.sidebar');

// good
const $sidebarBtn = $('.sidebar-btn');





26.2 Cache jQuery lookups.
// bad
function setSidebar() {
  $('.sidebar').hide();

  // ...

  $('.sidebar').css({
    'background-color': 'pink',
  });
}

// good
function setSidebar() {
  const $sidebar = $('.sidebar');
  $sidebar.hide();

  // ...

  $sidebar.css({
    'background-color': 'pink',
  });
}




26.3 For DOM queries use Cascading $('.sidebar ul') or parent > child $('.sidebar > ul'). jsPerf




26.4 Use find with scoped jQuery object queries.
// bad
$('ul', '.sidebar').hide();

// bad
$('.sidebar').find('ul').hide();

// good
$('.sidebar ul').hide();

// good
$('.sidebar > ul').hide();

// good
$sidebar.find('ul').hide();

ECMAScript 5 Compatibility


27.1 Refer to Kangax’s ES5 compatibility table.

Object Shorthand
Object Concise
Object Computed Properties
Template Strings
Destructuring
Default Parameters
Rest
Array Spreads
Let and Const

Modules




28.2 Do not use TC39 proposals that have not reached stage 3.

Why? They are not finalized, and they are subject to change or to be withdrawn entirely. We want to use JavaScript, and proposals are not JavaScript yet.



⬆ back to top
Standard Library
The Standard Library
contains utilities that are functionally broken but remain for legacy reasons.



29.1 Use Number.isNaN instead of global isNaN.
eslint: no-restricted-globals

Why? The global isNaN coerces non-numbers to numbers, returning true for anything that coerces to NaN.
If this behavior is desired, make it explicit.

// bad
isNaN('1.2'); // false
isNaN('1.2.3'); // true

// good
Number.isNaN('1.2.3'); // false
Number.isNaN(Number('1.2.3')); // true





29.2 Use Number.isFinite instead of global isFinite.
eslint: no-restricted-globals

Why? The global isFinite coerces non-numbers to numbers, returning true for anything that coerces to a finite number.
If this behavior is desired, make it explicit.

// bad
isFinite('2e3'); // true

// good
Number.isFinite('2e3'); // false
Number.isFinite(parseInt('2e3', 10)); // true


⬆ back to top
Testing



30.1 Yup.
function foo() {
  return true;
}




30.2 No, but seriously:

Whichever testing framework you use, you should be writing tests!
Strive to write many small pure functions, and minimize where mutations occur.
Be cautious about stubs and mocks - they can make your tests more brittle.
We primarily use mocha and jest at Airbnb. tape is also used occasionally for small, separate modules.
100% test coverage is a good goal to strive for, even if it’s not always practical to reach it.
Whenever you fix a bug, write a regression test. A bug fixed without a regression test is almost certainly going to break again in the future.

The Electron framework lets you write cross-platform desktop applications
using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is based on Node.js and
Chromium and is used by the Atom
editor and many other apps.
Follow @ElectronJS on Twitter for important
announcements.
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant
code of conduct.
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable
behavior to coc@electronjs.org.
Installation
To install prebuilt Electron binaries, use npm.
The preferred method is to install Electron as a development dependency in your
app:
npm install electron --save-dev [--save-exact]
The --save-exact flag is recommended for Electron prior to version 2, as it does not follow semantic
versioning. As of version 2.0.0, Electron follows semver, so you don't need --save-exact flag. For info on how to manage Electron versions in your apps, see
Electron versioning.
For more installation options and troubleshooting tips, see
installation.
Quick start & Electron Fiddle
Use Electron Fiddle
to build, run, and package small Electron experiments, to see code examples for all of Electron's APIs, and
to try out different versions of Electron. It's designed to make the start of your journey with
Electron easier.
Alternatively, clone and run the
electron/electron-quick-start
repository to see a minimal Electron app in action:
git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
cd electron-quick-start
npm install
npm start
Resources for learning Electron

electronjs.org/docs - all of Electron's documentation

Programmatic usage
Most people use Electron from the command line, but if you require electron inside
your Node app (not your Electron app) it will return the file path to the
binary. Use this to spawn Electron from Node scripts:
const electron = require('electron')
const proc = require('child_process')

// will print something similar to /Users/maf/.../Electron
console.log(electron)

// spawn Electron
const child = proc.spawn(electron)

Create React App  
Create React apps with no build configuration.

Creating an App – How to create a new app.
User Guide – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

Create React App works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
If something doesn’t work, please file an issue.
Quick Overview
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)
Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.



Get Started Immediately
You don’t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.
Just create a project, and you’re good to go.
Creating an App
You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:
npx
npx create-react-app my-app
(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)
npm
npm init react-app my-app
npm init <initializer> is available in npm 6+
Yarn
yarn create react-app my-app
yarn create is available in Yarn 0.25+
It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed.
User Guide
You can find detailed instructions on using Create React App and many tips in its documentation.
How to Update to New Versions?
Please refer to the User Guide for this and other information.
Philosophy


One Dependency: There is just one build dependency. It uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.


No Configuration Required: You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.


No Lock-In: You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.


What’s Included?
Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.
Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
An offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web App criteria. (Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher)
Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

Check out this guide for an overview of how these tools fit together.
The tradeoff is that these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way. If your project needs more customization, you can ""eject"" and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.
Popular Alternatives
Create React App is a great fit for:

Learning React in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment.
Starting new single-page React applications.
Creating examples with React for your libraries and components.

Here are a few common cases where you might want to try something else:


If you want to try React without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead.


If you need to integrate React code with a server-side template framework like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you’re not building a single-page app, consider using nwb, or Neutrino which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use Rails Webpacker. For Symfony, try Symfony's Webpack Encore.


If you need to publish a React component, nwb can also do this, as well as Neutrino's react-components preset.


If you want to do server rendering with React and Node.js, check out Next.js or Razzle. Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and just produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles.


If your website is mostly static (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using Gatsby instead. Unlike Create React App, it pre-renders the website into HTML at the build time.


Finally, if you need more customization, check out Neutrino and its React preset.


All of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.
If you prefer configuring the build yourself, follow this guide.

Flutter is Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces
on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by
developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

mailing list.
About Flutter
We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model.
Beautiful apps
We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's layered architecture gives you control over every pixel on the
screen, and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
set of widgets that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on both
iOS and Android.

Fast apps
Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated Skia 2D
graphics library that underpins Chrome and Android. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.
Flutter code is powered by the world-class Dart platform, which enables
compilation to native 32-bit and 64-bit ARM code for iOS and Android.
Productive development
Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

Extensible and open model
Flutter works with any development tool, but includes editor plug-ins for both
Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ / Android Studio. Flutter provides
thousands of packages to speed your development, regardless
of your target platform. And accessing platform features is easy. Here is a
snippet from our interop example:
Future<void> getBatteryLevel() async {
  var batteryLevel = 'unknown';
  try {
    int result = await methodChannel.invokeMethod('getBatteryLevel');
    batteryLevel = 'Battery level: $result%';
  } on PlatformException {
    batteryLevel = 'Failed to get battery level.';
  }
  setState(() {
    _batteryLevel = batteryLevel;
  });
}
Flutter is a fully open source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found at our
contributor guide.

Study guide

Suggested topics to review based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).


Q: For interviews, do I need to know everything here?
A: No, you don't need to know everything here to prepare for the interview.
What you are asked in an interview depends on variables such as:

How much experience you have
What your technical background is
What positions you are interviewing for
Which companies you are interviewing with
Luck

More experienced candidates are generally expected to know more about system design.  Architects or team leads might be expected to know more than individual contributors.  Top tech companies are likely to have one or more design interview rounds.
Start broad and go deeper in a few areas.  It helps to know a little about various key system design topics.  Adjust the following guide based on your timeline, experience, what positions you are interviewing for, and which companies you are interviewing with.

Short timeline - Aim for breadth with system design topics.  Practice by solving some interview questions.
Medium timeline - Aim for breadth and some depth with system design topics.  Practice by solving many interview questions.
Long timeline - Aim for breadth and more depth with system design topics.  Practice by solving most interview questions.

How to approach a system design interview question

How to tackle a system design interview question.

The system design interview is an open-ended conversation.  You are expected to lead it.
You can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the System design interview questions with solutions section using the following steps.
Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions
Gather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.

Who is going to use it?
How are they going to use it?
How many users are there?
What does the system do?
What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
How much data do we expect to handle?
How many requests per second do we expect?
What is the expected read to write ratio?

Step 2: Create a high level design
Outline a high level design with all important components.

Sketch the main components and connections
Justify your ideas

Step 3: Design core components
Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to design a url shortening service, discuss:

Generating and storing a hash of the full url

MD5 and Base62
Hash collisions
SQL or NoSQL
Database schema


Translating a hashed url to the full url

Database lookup


API and object-oriented design

Step 4: Scale the design
Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?

Load balancer
Horizontal scaling
Caching
Database sharding

Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using principles of scalable system design.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations
You might be asked to do some estimates by hand.  Refer to the Appendix for the following resources:

Use back of the envelope calculations
Powers of two table
Latency numbers every programmer should know

Next steps
Next, we'll look at high-level trade-offs:

Performance vs scalability
Latency vs throughput
Availability vs consistency

Keep in mind that everything is a trade-off.
Then we'll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.
Performance vs scalability
A service is scalable if it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.1
Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user.
If you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

Latency vs throughput
Latency is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.
Throughput is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.
Generally, you should aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency.

Availability vs consistency
CAP theorem



Source: CAP theorem revisited

In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:

Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
Availability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
Partition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures

Networks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance.  You'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.
CP - consistency and partition tolerance
Waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error.  CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.
AP - availability and partition tolerance
Responses return the most recent version of the data available on a node, which might not be the latest.  Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.
AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for eventual consistency or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.

CAP FAQ

Consistency patterns
With multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data.  Recall the definition of consistency from the CAP theorem - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
Weak consistency
After a write, reads may or may not see it.  A best effort approach is taken.
This approach is seen in systems such as memcached.  Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games.  For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.
Eventual consistency
After a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds).  Data is replicated asynchronously.
This approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email.  Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.
Strong consistency
After a write, reads will see it.  Data is replicated synchronously.
This approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes.  Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.

Transactions across data centers

Availability patterns
There are two main patterns to support high availability: fail-over and replication.
Fail-over
Active-passive
With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby.  If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.
The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standby or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby.  Only the active server handles traffic.
Active-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.
Active-active
In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.
If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers.  If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.
Active-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.
Disadvantage(s): failover

Fail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.
There is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.

Replication
Master-slave and master-master
This topic is further discussed in the Database section:

Domain name system



Source: DNS security presentation

A Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address.
DNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level.  Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup.  Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays.  DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the time to live (TTL).

NS record (name server) - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.
MX record (mail exchange) - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.
A record (address) - Points a name to an IP address.
CNAME (canonical) - Points a name to another name or CNAME (example.com to www.example.com) or to an A record.

Services such as CloudFlare and Route 53 provide managed DNS services.  Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:

Weighted round robin

Prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance
Balance between varying cluster sizes
A/B testing


Latency-based
Geolocation-based

Disadvantage(s): DNS

Accessing a DNS server introduces a slight delay, although mitigated by caching described above.
DNS server management could be complex and is generally managed by governments, ISPs, and large companies.
DNS services have recently come under DDoS attack, preventing users from accessing websites such as Twitter without knowing Twitter's IP address(es).

Content delivery network



Source: Why use a CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user.  Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content.  The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.
Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:

Users receive content at data centers close to them
Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills

Push CDNs
Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server.  You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN.  You can configure when content expires and when it is updated.  Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.
Sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't often updated work well with push CDNs.  Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.
Pull CDNs
Pull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content.  You leave the content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN.  This results in a slower request until the content is cached on the CDN.
A time-to-live (TTL) determines how long content is cached.  Pull CDNs minimize storage space on the CDN, but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed.
Sites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.
Disadvantage(s): CDN

CDN costs could be significant depending on traffic, although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a CDN.
Content might be stale if it is updated before the TTL expires it.
CDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN.

Load balancer



Source: Scalable system design patterns

Load balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases.  In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client.  Load balancers are effective at:

Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers
Preventing overloading resources
Helping eliminate single points of failure

Load balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy.
Additional benefits include:

SSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations

Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server


Session persistence - Issue cookies and route a specific client's requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions

To protect against failures, it's common to set up multiple load balancers, either in active-passive or active-active mode.
Load balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:

Random
Least loaded
Session/cookies
Round robin or weighted round robin
Layer 4
Layer 7

Layer 4 load balancing
Layer 4 load balancers look at info at the transport layer to decide how to distribute requests.  Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet.  Layer 4 load balancers forward network packets to and from the upstream server, performing Network Address Translation (NAT).
Layer 7 load balancing
Layer 7 load balancers look at the application layer to decide how to distribute requests.  This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies.  Layer 7 load balancers terminates network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server.  For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.
At the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.
Horizontal scaling
Load balancers can also help with horizontal scaling, improving performance and availability.  Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called Vertical Scaling.  It is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems.
Disadvantage(s): horizontal scaling

Scaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers

Servers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures
Sessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a database (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent cache (Redis, Memcached)


Downstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out

Disadvantage(s): load balancer

The load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly.
Introducing a load balancer to help eliminate single points of failure results in increased complexity.
A single load balancer is a single point of failure, configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity.

Reverse proxy (web server)



Source: Wikipedia


A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public.  Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.
Additional benefits include:

Increased security - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client
Increased scalability and flexibility - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration
SSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations

Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server


Compression - Compress server responses
Caching - Return the response for cached requests
Static content - Serve static content directly

HTML/CSS/JS
Photos
Videos
Etc



Load balancer vs reverse proxy

Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers.  Often, load balancers  route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.
Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.
Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.

Disadvantage(s): reverse proxy

Introducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.
A single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a failover) further increases complexity.

Application layer



Source: Intro to architecting systems for scale

Separating out the web layer from the application layer (also known as platform layer) allows you to scale and configure both layers independently.  Adding a new API results in adding application servers without necessarily adding additional web servers.  The single responsibility principle advocates for small and autonomous services that work together.  Small teams with small services can plan more aggressively for rapid growth.
Workers in the application layer also help enable asynchronism.
Microservices
Related to this discussion are microservices, which can be described as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services.  Each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. 1
Pinterest, for example, could have the following microservices: user profile, follower, feed, search, photo upload, etc.
Service Discovery
Systems such as Consul, Etcd, and Zookeeper can help services find each other by keeping track of registered names, addresses, and ports.  Health checks help verify service integrity and are often done using an HTTP endpoint.  Both Consul and Etcd have a built in key-value store that can be useful for storing config values and other shared data.
Disadvantage(s): application layer

Adding an application layer with loosely coupled services requires a different approach from an architectural, operations, and process viewpoint (vs a monolithic system).
Microservices can add complexity in terms of deployments and operations.

Database



Source: Scaling up to your first 10 million users

Relational database management system (RDBMS)
A relational database like SQL is a collection of data items organized in tables.
ACID is a set of properties of relational database transactions.

Atomicity - Each transaction is all or nothing
Consistency - Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another
Isolation - Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially
Durability - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so

There are many techniques to scale a relational database: master-slave replication, master-master replication, federation, sharding, denormalization, and SQL tuning.
Master-slave replication
The master serves reads and writes, replicating writes to one or more slaves, which serve only reads.  Slaves can also replicate to additional slaves in a tree-like fashion.  If the master goes offline, the system can continue to operate in read-only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is provisioned.



Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns

Disadvantage(s): master-slave replication

Additional logic is needed to promote a slave to a master.
See Disadvantage(s): replication for points related to both master-slave and master-master.

Master-master replication
Both masters serve reads and writes and coordinate with each other on writes.  If either master goes down, the system can continue to operate with both reads and writes.



Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns

Disadvantage(s): master-master replication

You'll need a load balancer or you'll need to make changes to your application logic to determine where to write.
Most master-master systems are either loosely consistent (violating ACID) or have increased write latency due to synchronization.
Conflict resolution comes more into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.
See Disadvantage(s): replication for points related to both master-slave and master-master.

Disadvantage(s): replication

There is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.
Writes are replayed to the read replicas.  If there are a lot of writes, the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and can't do as many reads.
The more read slaves, the more you have to replicate, which leads to greater replication lag.
On some systems, writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel, whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread.
Replication adds more hardware and additional complexity.

Multi-master replication

Federation



Source: Scaling up to your first 10 million users

Federation (or functional partitioning) splits up databases by function.  For example, instead of a single, monolithic database, you could have three databases: forums, users, and products, resulting in less read and write traffic to each database and therefore less replication lag.  Smaller databases result in more data that can fit in memory, which in turn results in more cache hits due to improved cache locality.  With no single central master serializing writes you can write in parallel, increasing throughput.
Disadvantage(s): federation

Federation is not effective if your schema requires huge functions or tables.
You'll need to update your application logic to determine which database to read and write.
Joining data from two databases is more complex with a server link.
Federation adds more hardware and additional complexity.

Source(s) and further reading: federation

Scaling up to your first 10 million users

Sharding



Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns

Sharding distributes data across different databases such that each database can only manage a subset of the data.  Taking a users database as an example, as the number of users increases, more shards are added to the cluster.
Similar to the advantages of federation, sharding results in less read and write traffic, less replication, and more cache hits.  Index size is also reduced, which generally improves performance with faster queries.  If one shard goes down, the other shards are still operational, although you'll want to add some form of replication to avoid data loss.  Like federation, there is no single central master serializing writes, allowing you to write in parallel with increased throughput.
Common ways to shard a table of users is either through the user's last name initial or the user's geographic location.
Disadvantage(s): sharding

You'll need to update your application logic to work with shards, which could result in complex SQL queries.
Data distribution can become lopsided in a shard.  For example, a set of power users on a shard could result in increased load to that shard compared to others.

Rebalancing adds additional complexity.  A sharding function based on consistent hashing can reduce the amount of transferred data.


Joining data from multiple shards is more complex.
Sharding adds more hardware and additional complexity.

Consistent hashing

Denormalization
Denormalization attempts to improve read performance at the expense of some write performance.  Redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins.  Some RDBMS such as PostgreSQL and Oracle support materialized views which handle the work of storing redundant information and keeping redundant copies consistent.
Once data becomes distributed with techniques such as federation and sharding, managing joins across data centers further increases complexity.  Denormalization might circumvent the need for such complex joins.
In most systems, reads can heavily outnumber writes 100:1 or even 1000:1.  A read resulting in a complex database join can be very expensive, spending a significant amount of time on disk operations.
Disadvantage(s): denormalization

Data is duplicated.
Constraints can help redundant copies of information stay in sync, which increases complexity of the database design.
A denormalized database under heavy write load might perform worse than its normalized counterpart.

Source(s) and further reading: denormalization

Denormalization

SQL tuning
SQL tuning is a broad topic and many books have been written as reference.
It's important to benchmark and profile to simulate and uncover bottlenecks.

Benchmark - Simulate high-load situations with tools such as ab.
Profile - Enable tools such as the slow query log to help track performance issues.

Benchmarking and profiling might point you to the following optimizations.
Tighten up the schema

MySQL dumps to disk in contiguous blocks for fast access.
Use CHAR instead of VARCHAR for fixed-length fields.

CHAR effectively allows for fast, random access, whereas with VARCHAR, you must find the end of a string before moving onto the next one.


Use TEXT for large blocks of text such as blog posts.  TEXT also allows for boolean searches.  Using a TEXT field results in storing a pointer on disk that is used to locate the text block.
Use INT for larger numbers up to 2^32 or 4 billion.
Use DECIMAL for currency to avoid floating point representation errors.
Avoid storing large BLOBS, store the location of where to get the object instead.
VARCHAR(255) is the largest number of characters that can be counted in an 8 bit number, often maximizing the use of a byte in some RDBMS.
Set the NOT NULL constraint where applicable to improve search performance.

Use good indices

Columns that you are querying (SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN) could be faster with indices.
Indices are usually represented as self-balancing B-tree that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
Placing an index can keep the data in memory, requiring more space.
Writes could also be slower since the index also needs to be updated.
When loading large amounts of data, it might be faster to disable indices, load the data, then rebuild the indices.

Avoid expensive joins

Denormalize where performance demands it.

Partition tables

Break up a table by putting hot spots in a separate table to help keep it in memory.

Tune the query cache

In some cases, the query cache could lead to performance issues.

NoSQL
NoSQL is a collection of data items represented in a key-value store, document store, wide column store, or a graph database.  Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code.  Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions and favor eventual consistency.
BASE is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases.  In comparison with the CAP Theorem, BASE chooses availability over consistency.

Basically available - the system guarantees availability.
Soft state - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.
Eventual consistency - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that period.

In addition to choosing between SQL or NoSQL, it is helpful to understand which type of NoSQL database best fits your use case(s).  We'll review key-value stores, document stores, wide column stores, and graph databases in the next section.
Key-value store

Abstraction: hash table

A key-value store generally allows for O(1) reads and writes and is often backed by memory or SSD.  Data stores can maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of key ranges.  Key-value stores can allow for storing of metadata with a value.
Key-value stores provide high performance and are often used for simple data models or for rapidly-changing data, such as an in-memory cache layer.  Since they offer only a limited set of operations, complexity is shifted to the application layer if additional operations are needed.
A key-value store is the basis for more complex systems such as a document store, and in some cases, a graph database.

Disadvantages of key-value stores

Document store

Abstraction: key-value store with documents stored as values

A document store is centered around documents (XML, JSON, binary, etc), where a document stores all information for a given object.  Document stores provide APIs or a query language to query based on the internal structure of the document itself.  Note, many key-value stores include features for working with a value's metadata, blurring the lines between these two storage types.
Based on the underlying implementation, documents are organized by collections, tags, metadata, or directories.  Although documents can be organized or grouped together, documents may have fields that are completely different from each other.
Some document stores like MongoDB and CouchDB also provide a SQL-like language to perform complex queries.  DynamoDB supports both key-values and documents.
Document stores provide high flexibility and are often used for working with occasionally changing data.

Wide column store



Source: SQL & NoSQL, a brief history


Abstraction: nested map ColumnFamily<RowKey, Columns<ColKey, Value, Timestamp>>

A wide column store's basic unit of data is a column (name/value pair).  A column can be grouped in column families (analogous to a SQL table).  Super column families further group column families.  You can access each column independently with a row key, and columns with the same row key form a row.  Each value contains a timestamp for versioning and for conflict resolution.
Google introduced Bigtable as the first wide column store, which influenced the open-source HBase often-used in the Hadoop ecosystem, and Cassandra from Facebook.  Stores such as BigTable, HBase, and Cassandra maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of selective key ranges.
Wide column stores offer high availability and high scalability.  They are often used for very large data sets.

In a graph database, each node is a record and each arc is a relationship between two nodes.  Graph databases are optimized to represent complex relationships with many foreign keys or many-to-many relationships.
Graphs databases offer high performance for data models with complex relationships, such as a social network.  They are relatively new and are not yet widely-used; it might be more difficult to find development tools and resources.  Many graphs can only be accessed with REST APIs.

Cache



Source: Scalable system design patterns

Caching improves page load times and can reduce the load on your servers and databases.  In this model, the dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution.
Databases often benefit from a uniform distribution of reads and writes across its partitions.  Popular items can skew the distribution, causing bottlenecks.  Putting a cache in front of a database can help absorb uneven loads and spikes in traffic.
Client caching
Caches can be located on the client side (OS or browser), server side, or in a distinct cache layer.
CDN caching
CDNs are considered a type of cache.
Web server caching
Reverse proxies and caches such as Varnish can serve static and dynamic content directly.  Web servers can also cache requests, returning responses without having to contact application servers.
Database caching
Your database usually includes some level of caching in a default configuration, optimized for a generic use case.  Tweaking these settings for specific usage patterns can further boost performance.
Application caching
In-memory caches such as Memcached and Redis are key-value stores between your application and your data storage.  Since the data is held in RAM, it is much faster than typical databases where data is stored on disk.  RAM is more limited than disk, so cache invalidation algorithms such as least recently used (LRU) can help invalidate 'cold' entries and keep 'hot' data in RAM.
Redis has the following additional features:

Persistence option
Built-in data structures such as sorted sets and lists

There are multiple levels you can cache that fall into two general categories: database queries and objects:

Row level
Query-level
Fully-formed serializable objects
Fully-rendered HTML

Generally, you should try to avoid file-based caching, as it makes cloning and auto-scaling more difficult.
Caching at the database query level
Whenever you query the database, hash the query as a key and store the result to the cache.  This approach suffers from expiration issues:

Hard to delete a cached result with complex queries
If one piece of data changes such as a table cell, you need to delete all cached queries that might include the changed cell

Caching at the object level
See your data as an object, similar to what you do with your application code.  Have your application assemble the dataset from the database into a class instance or a data structure(s):

Remove the object from cache if its underlying data has changed
Allows for asynchronous processing: workers assemble objects by consuming the latest cached object

Suggestions of what to cache:

User sessions
Fully rendered web pages
Activity streams
User graph data

When to update the cache
Since you can only store a limited amount of data in cache, you'll need to determine which cache update strategy works best for your use case.
Cache-aside



Source: From cache to in-memory data grid

The application is responsible for reading and writing from storage.  The cache does not interact with storage directly.  The application does the following:

Look for entry in cache, resulting in a cache miss
Load entry from the database
Add entry to cache
Return entry

def get_user(self, user_id):
    user = cache.get(""user.{0}"", user_id)
    if user is None:
        user = db.query(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}"", user_id)
        if user is not None:
            key = ""user.{0}"".format(user_id)
            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))
    return user
Memcached is generally used in this manner.
Subsequent reads of data added to cache are fast.  Cache-aside is also referred to as lazy loading.  Only requested data is cached, which avoids filling up the cache with data that isn't requested.
Disadvantage(s): cache-aside

Each cache miss results in three trips, which can cause a noticeable delay.
Data can become stale if it is updated in the database.  This issue is mitigated by setting a time-to-live (TTL) which forces an update of the cache entry, or by using write-through.
When a node fails, it is replaced by a new, empty node, increasing latency.

Write-through

The application uses the cache as the main data store, reading and writing data to it, while the cache is responsible for reading and writing to the database:

Application adds/updates entry in cache
Cache synchronously writes entry to data store
Return

Application code:
set_user(12345, {""foo"":""bar""})
Cache code:
def set_user(user_id, values):
    user = db.query(""UPDATE Users WHERE id = {0}"", user_id, values)
    cache.set(user_id, user)
Write-through is a slow overall operation due to the write operation, but subsequent reads of just written data are fast.  Users are generally more tolerant of latency when updating data than reading data.  Data in the cache is not stale.
Disadvantage(s): write through

When a new node is created due to failure or scaling, the new node will not cache entries until the entry is updated in the database.  Cache-aside in conjunction with write through can mitigate this issue.
Most data written might never be read, which can be minimized with a TTL.

Write-behind (write-back)



Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns

In write-behind, the application does the following:

Add/update entry in cache
Asynchronously write entry to the data store, improving write performance

Disadvantage(s): write-behind

There could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store.
It is more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through.

Refresh-ahead



Source: From cache to in-memory data grid

You can configure the cache to automatically refresh any recently accessed cache entry prior to its expiration.
Refresh-ahead can result in reduced latency vs read-through if the cache can accurately predict which items are likely to be needed in the future.
Disadvantage(s): refresh-ahead

Not accurately predicting which items are likely to be needed in the future can result in reduced performance than without refresh-ahead.

Disadvantage(s): cache

Need to maintain consistency between caches and the source of truth such as the database through cache invalidation.
Cache invalidation is a difficult problem, there is additional complexity associated with when to update the cache.
Need to make application changes such as adding Redis or memcached.

Asynchronism



Source: Intro to architecting systems for scale

Asynchronous workflows help reduce request times for expensive operations that would otherwise be performed in-line.  They can also help by doing time-consuming work in advance, such as periodic aggregation of data.
Message queues
Message queues receive, hold, and deliver messages.  If an operation is too slow to perform inline, you can use a message queue with the following workflow:

An application publishes a job to the queue, then notifies the user of job status
A worker picks up the job from the queue, processes it, then signals the job is complete

The user is not blocked and the job is processed in the background.  During this time, the client might optionally do a small amount of processing to make it seem like the task has completed.  For example, if posting a tweet, the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline, but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers.
Redis is useful as a simple message broker but messages can be lost.
RabbitMQ is popular but requires you to adapt to the 'AMQP' protocol and manage your own nodes.
Amazon SQS is hosted but can have high latency and has the possibility of messages being delivered twice.
Task queues
Tasks queues receive tasks and their related data, runs them, then delivers their results.  They can support scheduling and can be used to run computationally-intensive jobs in the background.
Celery has support for scheduling and primarily has python support.
Back pressure
If queues start to grow significantly, the queue size can become larger than memory, resulting in cache misses, disk reads, and even slower performance.  Back pressure can help by limiting the queue size, thereby maintaining a high throughput rate and good response times for jobs already in the queue.  Once the queue fills up, clients get a server busy or HTTP 503 status code to try again later.  Clients can retry the request at a later time, perhaps with exponential backoff.
Disadvantage(s): asynchronism

Use cases such as inexpensive calculations and realtime workflows might be better suited for synchronous operations, as introducing queues can add delays and complexity.

Communication



Source: OSI 7 layer model

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
HTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server.  It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request.  HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.
A basic HTTP request consists of a verb (method) and a resource (endpoint).  Below are common HTTP verbs:



Verb
Description
Idempotent*
Safe
Cacheable




GET
Reads a resource
Yes
Yes
Yes


POST
Creates a resource or trigger a process that handles data
No
No
Yes if response contains freshness info


PUT
Creates or replace a resource
Yes
No
No


PATCH
Partially updates a resource
No
No
Yes if response contains freshness info


DELETE
Deletes a resource
Yes
No
No



*Can be called many times without different outcomes.
HTTP is an application layer protocol relying on lower-level protocols such as TCP and UDP.

Transmission control protocol (TCP)



Source: How to make a multiplayer game

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol over an IP network.  Connection is established and terminated using a handshake.  All packets sent are guaranteed to reach the destination in the original order and without corruption through:

Sequence numbers and checksum fields for each packet
Acknowledgement packets and automatic retransmission

If the sender does not receive a correct response, it will resend the packets.  If there are multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped.  TCP also implements flow control and congestion control.  These guarantees cause delays and generally result in less efficient transmission than UDP.
To ensure high throughput, web servers can keep a large number of TCP connections open, resulting in high memory usage.  It can be expensive to have a large number of open connections between web server threads and say, a memcached server.  Connection pooling can help in addition to switching to UDP where applicable.
TCP is useful for applications that require high reliability but are less time critical.  Some examples include web servers, database info, SMTP, FTP, and SSH.
Use TCP over UDP when:

You need all of the data to arrive intact
You want to automatically make a best estimate use of the network throughput

User datagram protocol (UDP)



Source: How to make a multiplayer game

UDP is connectionless.  Datagrams (analogous to packets) are guaranteed only at the datagram level.  Datagrams might reach their destination out of order or not at all.  UDP does not support congestion control.  Without the guarantees that TCP support, UDP is generally more efficient.
UDP can broadcast, sending datagrams to all devices on the subnet.  This is useful with DHCP because the client has not yet received an IP address, thus preventing a way for TCP to stream without the IP address.
UDP is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, streaming, and realtime multiplayer games.
Use UDP over TCP when:

You need the lowest latency
Late data is worse than loss of data
You want to implement your own error correction

Remote procedure call (RPC)



Source: Crack the system design interview

In an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server.  The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program.  Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls.  Popular RPC frameworks include Protobuf, Thrift, and Avro.
RPC is a request-response protocol:

Client program - Calls the client stub procedure.  The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.
Client stub procedure - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.
Client communication module - OS sends the message from the client to the server.
Server communication module - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.
Server stub procedure -  Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.
The server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.

Sample RPC calls:
GET /someoperation?data=anId

POST /anotheroperation
{
  ""data"":""anId"";
  ""anotherdata"": ""another value""
}

RPC is focused on exposing behaviors.  RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.
Choose a native library (aka SDK) when:

You know your target platform.
You want to control how your ""logic"" is accessed.
You want to control how error control happens off your library.
Performance and end user experience is your primary concern.

HTTP APIs following REST tend to be used more often for public APIs.
Disadvantage(s): RPC

RPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.
A new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.
It can be difficult to debug RPC.
You might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box.  For example, it might require additional effort to ensure RPC calls are properly cached on caching servers such as Squid.

Representational state transfer (REST)
REST is an architectural style enforcing a client/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server.  The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources.  All communication must be stateless and cacheable.
There are four qualities of a RESTful interface:

Identify resources (URI in HTTP) - use the same URI regardless of any operation.
Change with representations (Verbs in HTTP) - use verbs, headers, and body.
Self-descriptive error message (status response in HTTP) - Use status codes, don't reinvent the wheel.
HATEOAS (HTML interface for HTTP) - your web service should be fully accessible in a browser.

Sample REST calls:
GET /someresources/anId

PUT /someresources/anId
{""anotherdata"": ""another value""}

REST is focused on exposing data.  It minimizes the coupling between client/server and is often used for public HTTP APIs.  REST uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through URIs, representation through headers, and actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.  Being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning.
Disadvantage(s): REST

With REST being focused on exposing data, it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy.  For example, returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path.  With REST, it is likely to be implemented with a combination of URI path, query parameters, and possibly the request body.
REST typically relies on a few verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) which sometimes doesn't fit your use case.  For example, moving expired documents to the archive folder might not cleanly fit within these verbs.
Fetching complicated resources with nested hierarchies requires multiple round trips between the client and server to render single views, e.g. fetching content of a blog entry and the comments on that entry. For mobile applications operating in variable network conditions, these multiple roundtrips are highly undesirable.
Over time, more fields might be added to an API response and older clients will receive all new data fields, even those that they do not need, as a result, it bloats the payload size and leads to larger latencies.

Security
This section could use some updates.  Consider contributing!
Security is a broad topic.  Unless you have considerable experience, a security background, or are applying for a position that requires knowledge of security, you probably won't need to know more than the basics:

Encrypt in transit and at rest.
Sanitize all user inputs or any input parameters exposed to user to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Use the principle of least privilege.

Release Types

Current: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the
branch for its major version number (for example,
v10.x). Node.js releases a new
major version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in
April and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support
life of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)
each October.
LTS: Releases that receive Long-term Support, with a focus on stability
and security. Every even-numbered major version will become an LTS release.
LTS releases receive 18 months of Active LTS support and a further 12 months
of Maintenance. LTS release lines have alphabetically-ordered codenames,
beginning with v4 Argon. There are no breaking changes or feature additions,
except in some special circumstances.
Nightly: Code from the Current branch built every 24-hours when there are
changes. Use with caution.

Current and LTS releases follow Semantic Versioning. A
member of the Release Team signs each Current and LTS release.
For more information, see the
Release README.
Download
Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
Current and LTS Releases
https://nodejs.org/download/release/
The latest directory is an
alias for the latest Current release. The latest-codename directory is an
alias for the latest release from an LTS line. For example, the
latest-carbon directory
contains the latest Carbon (Node.js 8) release.
Nightly Releases
https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/
Each directory name and filename contains a date (in UTC time) and the commit
SHA at the HEAD of the release.
API Documentation
Documentation for the latest Current release is at https://nodejs.org/api/.
Version-specific documentation is available in each release directory in the
docs subdirectory. Version-specific documentation is also at
https://nodejs.org/download/docs/.
Verifying Binaries
Download directories contain a SHASUMS256.txt file with SHA checksums for the
files.
To download SHASUMS256.txt using curl:
$ curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt
To check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, run
it through sha256sum with a command such as:
$ grep node-vx.y.z.tar.gz SHASUMS256.txt | sha256sum -c -
For Current and LTS, the GPG detached signature of SHASUMS256.txt is in
SHASUMS256.txt.sig. You can use it with gpg to verify the integrity of
SHASUM256.txt. You will first need to import
the GPG keys of individuals authorized to create releases. To
import the keys:
$ gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys DD8F2338BAE7501E3DD5AC78C273792F7D83545D
See the bottom of this README for a full script to import active release keys.
Next, download the SHASUMS256.txt.sig for the release:
$ curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt.sig
Then use gpg --verify SHASUMS256.txt.sig SHASUMS256.txt to verify
the file's signature.

Version 5 – the iconic SVG, font, and CSS framework

The internet's most popular icon toolkit has been redesigned and built from
scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework,
official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to
a new CDN.

more about our
successful Kickstarter and plan. You can also order Font Awesome
Pro which includes tons more icons directly
from fontawesome.com.

Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?
Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don't plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.
Documentation is still available but it's moved to
https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0 and
https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1.
The Git repository for
v4.7.0 and
v3.2.1 can
be found in our GitHub releases.
Change log
We'll keep track of each release in the CHANGELOG.md
Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the releases.
Upgrading
From time-to-time we'll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.
Check out the UPGRADING.md guide when you upgrade your dependencies.
Code of conduct
We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
Contributing
Please read through our contributing guidelines.  Included
are directions for opening issues.
Versioning
Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.
The major version ""5"" is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:

Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
icon
We will never intentionally release a patch version update that breaks
backward compatibility
A minor release may include backward-incompatible changes but we will
write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
A minor or patch release will never remove icons
Bug fixes will be addressed as patch releases unless they include backward
incompatibility then they will be minor releases

License
Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

Icons — CC BY 4.0 License

In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.


Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License

In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.


Code — MIT License

In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.



Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.
We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

AngularJS 
AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser.  It lets you
use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade/Pug and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s
syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.  It automatically
synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches
the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.
It also helps with server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferred objects,

What to use AngularJS for and when to use it
AngularJS is the next generation framework where each component is designed to work with every other
component in an interconnected way like a well-oiled machine. AngularJS is JavaScript MVC made easy
and done right. (Well it is not really MVC, read on, to understand what this means.)
MVC, no, MV* done the right way!
MVC, short for Model-View-Controller, is a design pattern, i.e. how the code should be organized and
how the different parts of an application separated for proper readability and debugging. Model is
the data and the database. View is the user interface and what the user sees. Controller is the main
link between Model and View. These are the three pillars of major programming frameworks present on
the market today. On the other hand AngularJS works on MV*, short for Model-View-Whatever. The
Whatever is AngularJS's way of telling that you may create any kind of linking between the Model
and the View here.
Unlike other frameworks in any programming language, where MVC, the three separate components, each
one has to be written and then connected by the programmer, AngularJS helps the programmer by asking
him/her to just create these and everything else will be taken care of by AngularJS.
Interconnection with HTML at the root level
AngularJS uses HTML to define the user's interface. AngularJS also enables the programmer to write
new HTML tags (AngularJS Directives) and increase the readability and understandability of the HTML
code. Directives are AngularJS’s way of bringing additional functionality to HTML. Directives
achieve this by enabling us to invent our own HTML elements. This also helps in making the code DRY
(Don't Repeat Yourself), which means once created, a new directive can be used anywhere within the
application.
HTML is also used to determine the wiring of the app. Special attributes in the HTML determine where
to load the app, which components or controllers to use for each element, etc. We specify ""what""
gets loaded, but not ""how"". This declarative approach greatly simplifies app development in a sort
of WYSIWYG way. Rather than spending time on how the program flows and orchestrating the various
moving parts, we simply define what we want and AngularJS will take care of the dependencies.
Data Handling made simple
Data and Data Models in AngularJS are plain JavaScript objects and one can add and change properties
directly on it and loop over objects and arrays at will.
Two-way Data Binding
One of AngularJS's strongest features. Two-way Data Binding means that if something changes in the
Model, the change gets reflected in the View instantaneously, and the same happens the other way
around. This is also referred to as Reactive Programming, i.e. suppose a = b + c is being
programmed and after this, if the value of b and/or c is changed then the value of a will be
automatically updated to reflect the change. AngularJS uses its ""scopes"" as a glue between the Model
and View and makes these updates in one available for the other.
Less Written Code and Easily Maintainable Code
Everything in AngularJS is created to enable the programmer to end up writing less code that is
easily maintainable and readable by any other new person on the team. Believe it or not, one can
write a complete working two-way data binded application in less than 10 lines of code. Try and see
for yourself!
Testing Ready
AngularJS has Dependency Injection, i.e. it takes care of providing all the necessary dependencies
to its controllers and services whenever required. This helps in making the AngularJS code ready for
unit testing by making use of mock dependencies created and injected. This makes AngularJS more
modular and easily testable thus in turn helping a team create more robust applications.

Flutter is Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces
on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by
developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

flutter-announce@googlegroups.com
mailing list.
About Flutter
We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model.
Beautiful apps
We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's layered architecture gives you control over every pixel on the
screen, and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
set of widgets that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on both
iOS and Android.

Fast apps
Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated Skia 2D
graphics library that underpins Chrome and Android. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.
Flutter code is powered by the world-class Dart platform, which enables
compilation to native 32-bit and 64-bit ARM code for iOS and Android.
Productive development
Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

Extensible and open model
Flutter works with any development tool, but includes editor plug-ins for both
Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ / Android Studio. Flutter provides
thousands of packages to speed your development, regardless
of your target platform. And accessing platform features is easy. Here is a
snippet from our interop example:
Future<void> getBatteryLevel() async {
  var batteryLevel = 'unknown';
  try {
    int result = await methodChannel.invokeMethod('getBatteryLevel');
    batteryLevel = 'Battery level: $result%';
  } on PlatformException {
    batteryLevel = 'Failed to get battery level.';
  }
  setState(() {
    _batteryLevel = batteryLevel;
  });
}
Flutter is a fully open source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found at our
contributor guide.

Study guide

Suggested topics to review based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).


Q: For interviews, do I need to know everything here?
A: No, you don't need to know everything here to prepare for the interview.
What you are asked in an interview depends on variables such as:

How much experience you have
What your technical background is
What positions you are interviewing for
Which companies you are interviewing with
Luck

More experienced candidates are generally expected to know more about system design.  Architects or team leads might be expected to know more than individual contributors.  Top tech companies are likely to have one or more design interview rounds.
Start broad and go deeper in a few areas.  It helps to know a little about various key system design topics.  Adjust the following guide based on your timeline, experience, what positions you are interviewing for, and which companies you are interviewing with.

Short timeline - Aim for breadth with system design topics.  Practice by solving some interview questions.
Medium timeline - Aim for breadth and some depth with system design topics.  Practice by solving many interview questions.
Long timeline - Aim for breadth and more depth with system design topics.  Practice by solving most interview questions.

How to approach a system design interview question

How to tackle a system design interview question.

The system design interview is an open-ended conversation.  You are expected to lead it.
You can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the System design interview questions with solutions section using the following steps.
Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions
Gather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.

Who is going to use it?
How are they going to use it?
How many users are there?
What does the system do?
What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
How much data do we expect to handle?
How many requests per second do we expect?
What is the expected read to write ratio?

Step 2: Create a high level design
Outline a high level design with all important components.

Sketch the main components and connections
Justify your ideas

Step 3: Design core components
Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to design a url shortening service, discuss:

Generating and storing a hash of the full url

MD5 and Base62
Hash collisions
SQL or NoSQL
Database schema


Translating a hashed url to the full url

Database lookup

Next, we'll look at high-level trade-offs:

Performance vs scalability
Latency vs throughput
Availability vs consistency

Keep in mind that everything is a trade-off.
Then we'll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.
Performance vs scalability
A service is scalable if it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.1
Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user.
If you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

Availability vs consistency
CAP theorem



Source: CAP theorem revisited

In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:

Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
Availability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
Partition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures

Networks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance.  You'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.
CP - consistency and partition tolerance
Waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error.  CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.
AP - availability and partition tolerance
Responses return the most recent version of the data available on a node, which might not be the latest.  Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.
AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for eventual consistency or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.

CAP FAQ

Consistency patterns
With multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data.  Recall the definition of consistency from the CAP theorem - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
Weak consistency
After a write, reads may or may not see it.  A best effort approach is taken.
This approach is seen in systems such as memcached.  Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games.  For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.
Eventual consistency
After a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds).  Data is replicated asynchronously.
This approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email.  Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.
Strong consistency
After a write, reads will see it.  Data is replicated synchronously.
This approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes.  Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.
Source(s) and further reading

Transactions across data centers

Availability patterns
There are two main patterns to support high availability: fail-over and replication.
Fail-over
Active-passive
With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby.  If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.
The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standby or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby.  Only the active server handles traffic.
Active-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.
Active-active
In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.
If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers.  If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.
Active-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.
Disadvantage(s): failover

Fail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.
There is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.

Replication
Master-slave and master-master
This topic is further discussed in the Database section:

Domain name system



Source: DNS security presentation

A Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address.
DNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level.  Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup.  Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays.  DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the time to live (TTL).

NS record (name server) - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.
MX record (mail exchange) - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.
A record (address) - Points a name to an IP address.
CNAME (canonical) - Points a name to another name or CNAME (example.com to www.example.com) or to an A record.

Services such as CloudFlare and Route 53 provide managed DNS services.  Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:

Weighted round robin

Prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance
Balance between varying cluster sizes
A/B testing


Latency-based
Geolocation-based

Disadvantage(s): DNS

Accessing a DNS server introduces a slight delay, although mitigated by caching described above.
DNS server management could be complex and is generally managed by governments, ISPs, and large companies.
DNS services have recently come under DDoS attack, preventing users from accessing websites such as Twitter without knowing Twitter's IP address(es).

Content delivery network



Source: Why use a CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user.  Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content.  The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.
Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:

Users receive content at data centers close to them
Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills

Push CDNs
Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server.  You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN.  You can configure when content expires and when it is updated.  Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.
Sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't often updated work well with push CDNs.  Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.
Pull CDNs
Pull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content.  You leave the content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN.  This results in a slower request until the content is cached on the CDN.
A time-to-live (TTL) determines how long content is cached.  Pull CDNs minimize storage space on the CDN, but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed.
Sites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.
Disadvantage(s): CDN

CDN costs could be significant depending on traffic, although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a CDN.
Content might be stale if it is updated before the TTL expires it.
CDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN.

Load balancer



Source: Scalable system design patterns

Load balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases.  In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client.  Load balancers are effective at:

Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers
Preventing overloading resources
Helping eliminate single points of failure

Load balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy.
Additional benefits include:

SSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations

Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server


Session persistence - Issue cookies and route a specific client's requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions

To protect against failures, it's common to set up multiple load balancers, either in active-passive or active-active mode.
Load balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:

Random
Least loaded
Session/cookies
Round robin or weighted round robin
Layer 4
Layer 7

Layer 4 load balancing
Layer 4 load balancers look at info at the transport layer to decide how to distribute requests.  Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet.  Layer 4 load balancers forward network packets to and from the upstream server, performing Network Address Translation (NAT).
Layer 7 load balancing
Layer 7 load balancers look at the application layer to decide how to distribute requests.  This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies.  Layer 7 load balancers terminates network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server.  For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.
At the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.
Horizontal scaling
Load balancers can also help with horizontal scaling, improving performance and availability.  Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called Vertical Scaling.  It is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems.
Disadvantage(s): horizontal scaling

Scaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers

Servers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures
Sessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a database (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent cache (Redis, Memcached)


Downstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out

Disadvantage(s): load balancer

The load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly.
Introducing a load balancer to help eliminate single points of failure results in increased complexity.
A single load balancer is a single point of failure, configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity.

Reverse proxy (web server)



Source: Wikipedia


A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public.  Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.
Additional benefits include:

Increased security - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client
Increased scalability and flexibility - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration
SSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations

Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server


Compression - Compress server responses
Caching - Return the response for cached requests
Static content - Serve static content directly

HTML/CSS/JS
Photos
Videos
Etc



Load balancer vs reverse proxy

Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers.  Often, load balancers  route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.
Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.
Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.

Disadvantage(s): reverse proxy

Introducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.
A single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a failover) further increases complexity.

Application layer



Source: Intro to architecting systems for scale

Separating out the web layer from the application layer (also known as platform layer) allows you to scale and configure both layers independently.  Adding a new API results in adding application servers without necessarily adding additional web servers.  The single responsibility principle advocates for small and autonomous services that work together.  Small teams with small services can plan more aggressively for rapid growth.
Workers in the application layer also help enable asynchronism.
Microservices
Related to this discussion are microservices, which can be described as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services.  Each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. 1
Pinterest, for example, could have the following microservices: user profile, follower, feed, search, photo upload, etc.
Service Discovery
Systems such as Consul, Etcd, and Zookeeper can help services find each other by keeping track of registered names, addresses, and ports.  Health checks help verify service integrity and are often done using an HTTP endpoint.  Both Consul and Etcd have a built in key-value store that can be useful for storing config values and other shared data.
Disadvantage(s): application layer

Adding an application layer with loosely coupled services requires a different approach from an architectural, operations, and process viewpoint (vs a monolithic system).
Microservices can add complexity in terms of deployments and operations.

Database



Source: Scaling up to your first 10 million users

Relational database management system (RDBMS)
A relational database like SQL is a collection of data items organized in tables.
ACID is a set of properties of relational database transactions.

Atomicity - Each transaction is all or nothing
Consistency - Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another
Isolation - Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially
Durability - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so

There are many techniques to scale a relational database: master-slave replication, master-master replication, federation, sharding, denormalization, and SQL tuning.
Master-slave replication
The master serves reads and writes, replicating writes to one or more slaves, which serve only reads.  Slaves can also replicate to additional slaves in a tree-like fashion.  If the master goes offline, the system can continue to operate in read-only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is provisioned.



Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns

Disadvantage(s): master-slave replication

Additional logic is needed to promote a slave to a master.
See Disadvantage(s): replication for points related to both master-slave and master-master.

Master-master replication
Both masters serve reads and writes and coordinate with each other on writes.  If either master goes down, the system can continue to operate with both reads and writes.



Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns

Disadvantage(s): master-master replication

You'll need a load balancer or you'll need to make changes to your application logic to determine where to write.
Most master-master systems are either loosely consistent (violating ACID) or have increased write latency due to synchronization.
Conflict resolution comes more into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.
See Disadvantage(s): replication for points related to both master-slave and master-master.

Disadvantage(s): replication

There is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.
Writes are replayed to the read replicas.  If there are a lot of writes, the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and can't do as many reads.
The more read slaves, the more you have to replicate, which leads to greater replication lag.
On some systems, writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel, whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread.
Replication adds more hardware and additional complexity.

Scalability, availability, stability, patterns
Multi-master replication

Federation



Source: Scaling up to your first 10 million users

Federation (or functional partitioning) splits up databases by function.  For example, instead of a single, monolithic database, you could have three databases: forums, users, and products, resulting in less read and write traffic to each database and therefore less replication lag.  Smaller databases result in more data that can fit in memory, which in turn results in more cache hits due to improved cache locality.  With no single central master serializing writes you can write in parallel, increasing throughput.
Disadvantage(s): federation

Federation is not effective if your schema requires huge functions or tables.
You'll need to update your application logic to determine which database to read and write.
Joining data from two databases is more complex with a server link.
Federation adds more hardware and additional complexity.

Source(s) and further reading: federation

Scaling up to your first 10 million users

Sharding



Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns

Sharding distributes data across different databases such that each database can only manage a subset of the data.  Taking a users database as an example, as the number of users increases, more shards are added to the cluster.
Similar to the advantages of federation, sharding results in less read and write traffic, less replication, and more cache hits.  Index size is also reduced, which generally improves performance with faster queries.  If one shard goes down, the other shards are still operational, although you'll want to add some form of replication to avoid data loss.  Like federation, there is no single central master serializing writes, allowing you to write in parallel with increased throughput.
Common ways to shard a table of users is either through the user's last name initial or the user's geographic location.
Disadvantage(s): sharding

You'll need to update your application logic to work with shards, which could result in complex SQL queries.
Data distribution can become lopsided in a shard.  For example, a set of power users on a shard could result in increased load to that shard compared to others.

Rebalancing adds additional complexity.  A sharding function based on consistent hashing can reduce the amount of transferred data.


Joining data from multiple shards is more complex.
Sharding adds more hardware and additional complexity.

Consistent hashing

Denormalization
Denormalization attempts to improve read performance at the expense of some write performance.  Redundant copies of the data are written in multiple tables to avoid expensive joins.  Some RDBMS such as PostgreSQL and Oracle support materialized views which handle the work of storing redundant information and keeping redundant copies consistent.
Once data becomes distributed with techniques such as federation and sharding, managing joins across data centers further increases complexity.  Denormalization might circumvent the need for such complex joins.
In most systems, reads can heavily outnumber writes 100:1 or even 1000:1.  A read resulting in a complex database join can be very expensive, spending a significant amount of time on disk operations.
Disadvantage(s): denormalization

Data is duplicated.
Constraints can help redundant copies of information stay in sync, which increases complexity of the database design.
A denormalized database under heavy write load might perform worse than its normalized counterpart.

Source(s) and further reading: denormalization

Denormalization

SQL tuning
SQL tuning is a broad topic and many books have been written as reference.
It's important to benchmark and profile to simulate and uncover bottlenecks.

Benchmark - Simulate high-load situations with tools such as ab.
Profile - Enable tools such as the slow query log to help track performance issues.

Benchmarking and profiling might point you to the following optimizations.
Tighten up the schema

MySQL dumps to disk in contiguous blocks for fast access.
Use CHAR instead of VARCHAR for fixed-length fields.

CHAR effectively allows for fast, random access, whereas with VARCHAR, you must find the end of a string before moving onto the next one.


Use TEXT for large blocks of text such as blog posts.  TEXT also allows for boolean searches.  Using a TEXT field results in storing a pointer on disk that is used to locate the text block.
Use INT for larger numbers up to 2^32 or 4 billion.
Use DECIMAL for currency to avoid floating point representation errors.
Avoid storing large BLOBS, store the location of where to get the object instead.
VARCHAR(255) is the largest number of characters that can be counted in an 8 bit number, often maximizing the use of a byte in some RDBMS.
Set the NOT NULL constraint where applicable to improve search performance.

Use good indices

Columns that you are querying (SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN) could be faster with indices.
Indices are usually represented as self-balancing B-tree that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
Placing an index can keep the data in memory, requiring more space.
Writes could also be slower since the index also needs to be updated.
When loading large amounts of data, it might be faster to disable indices, load the data, then rebuild the indices.

Avoid expensive joins

Denormalize where performance demands it.

Partition tables

Break up a table by putting hot spots in a separate table to help keep it in memory.

Tune the query cache

In some cases, the query cache could lead to performance issues.

NoSQL
NoSQL is a collection of data items represented in a key-value store, document store, wide column store, or a graph database.  Data is denormalized, and joins are generally done in the application code.  Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions and favor eventual consistency.
BASE is often used to describe the properties of NoSQL databases.  In comparison with the CAP Theorem, BASE chooses availability over consistency.

Basically available - the system guarantees availability.
Soft state - the state of the system may change over time, even without input.
Eventual consistency - the system will become consistent over a period of time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that period.

In addition to choosing between SQL or NoSQL, it is helpful to understand which type of NoSQL database best fits your use case(s).  We'll review key-value stores, document stores, wide column stores, and graph databases in the next section.
Key-value store

Abstraction: hash table

A key-value store generally allows for O(1) reads and writes and is often backed by memory or SSD.  Data stores can maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of key ranges.  Key-value stores can allow for storing of metadata with a value.
Key-value stores provide high performance and are often used for simple data models or for rapidly-changing data, such as an in-memory cache layer.  Since they offer only a limited set of operations, complexity is shifted to the application layer if additional operations are needed.
A key-value store is the basis for more complex systems such as a document store, and in some cases, a graph database.

Document store

Abstraction: key-value store with documents stored as values

A document store is centered around documents (XML, JSON, binary, etc), where a document stores all information for a given object.  Document stores provide APIs or a query language to query based on the internal structure of the document itself.  Note, many key-value stores include features for working with a value's metadata, blurring the lines between these two storage types.
Based on the underlying implementation, documents are organized by collections, tags, metadata, or directories.  Although documents can be organized or grouped together, documents may have fields that are completely different from each other.
Some document stores like MongoDB and CouchDB also provide a SQL-like language to perform complex queries.  DynamoDB supports both key-values and documents.
Document stores provide high flexibility and are often used for working with occasionally changing data.

Wide column store



Source: SQL & NoSQL, a brief history


Abstraction: nested map ColumnFamily<RowKey, Columns<ColKey, Value, Timestamp>>

A wide column store's basic unit of data is a column (name/value pair).  A column can be grouped in column families (analogous to a SQL table).  Super column families further group column families.  You can access each column independently with a row key, and columns with the same row key form a row.  Each value contains a timestamp for versioning and for conflict resolution.
Google introduced Bigtable as the first wide column store, which influenced the open-source HBase often-used in the Hadoop ecosystem, and Cassandra from Facebook.  Stores such as BigTable, HBase, and Cassandra maintain keys in lexicographic order, allowing efficient retrieval of selective key ranges.
Wide column stores offer high availability and high scalability.  They are often used for very large data sets.

Graphs databases offer high performance for data models with complex relationships, such as a social network.  They are relatively new and are not yet widely-used; it might be more difficult to find development tools and resources.  Many graphs can only be accessed with REST APIs.

Cache



Source: Scalable system design patterns

Caching improves page load times and can reduce the load on your servers and databases.  In this model, the dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution.
Databases often benefit from a uniform distribution of reads and writes across its partitions.  Popular items can skew the distribution, causing bottlenecks.  Putting a cache in front of a database can help absorb uneven loads and spikes in traffic.
Client caching
Caches can be located on the client side (OS or browser), server side, or in a distinct cache layer.
CDN caching
CDNs are considered a type of cache.
Web server caching
Reverse proxies and caches such as Varnish can serve static and dynamic content directly.  Web servers can also cache requests, returning responses without having to contact application servers.
Database caching
Your database usually includes some level of caching in a default configuration, optimized for a generic use case.  Tweaking these settings for specific usage patterns can further boost performance.
Application caching
In-memory caches such as Memcached and Redis are key-value stores between your application and your data storage.  Since the data is held in RAM, it is much faster than typical databases where data is stored on disk.  RAM is more limited than disk, so cache invalidation algorithms such as least recently used (LRU) can help invalidate 'cold' entries and keep 'hot' data in RAM.
Redis has the following additional features:

Persistence option
Built-in data structures such as sorted sets and lists

There are multiple levels you can cache that fall into two general categories: database queries and objects:

Row level
Query-level
Fully-formed serializable objects
Fully-rendered HTML

Generally, you should try to avoid file-based caching, as it makes cloning and auto-scaling more difficult.
Caching at the database query level
Whenever you query the database, hash the query as a key and store the result to the cache.  This approach suffers from expiration issues:

Hard to delete a cached result with complex queries
If one piece of data changes such as a table cell, you need to delete all cached queries that might include the changed cell

Caching at the object level
See your data as an object, similar to what you do with your application code.  Have your application assemble the dataset from the database into a class instance or a data structure(s):

Remove the object from cache if its underlying data has changed
Allows for asynchronous processing: workers assemble objects by consuming the latest cached object

Suggestions of what to cache:

User sessions
Fully rendered web pages
Activity streams
User graph data

When to update the cache
Since you can only store a limited amount of data in cache, you'll need to determine which cache update strategy works best for your use case.
Cache-aside



Source: From cache to in-memory data grid

The application is responsible for reading and writing from storage.  The cache does not interact with storage directly.  The application does the following:

Look for entry in cache, resulting in a cache miss
Load entry from the database
Add entry to cache
Return entry

def get_user(self, user_id):
    user = cache.get(""user.{0}"", user_id)
    if user is None:
        user = db.query(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = {0}"", user_id)
        if user is not None:
            key = ""user.{0}"".format(user_id)
            cache.set(key, json.dumps(user))
    return user
Memcached is generally used in this manner.
Subsequent reads of data added to cache are fast.  Cache-aside is also referred to as lazy loading.  Only requested data is cached, which avoids filling up the cache with data that isn't requested.
Disadvantage(s): cache-aside

Each cache miss results in three trips, which can cause a noticeable delay.
Data can become stale if it is updated in the database.  This issue is mitigated by setting a time-to-live (TTL) which forces an update of the cache entry, or by using write-through.
When a node fails, it is replaced by a new, empty node, increasing latency.

Write-through



Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns

The application uses the cache as the main data store, reading and writing data to it, while the cache is responsible for reading and writing to the database:

Application adds/updates entry in cache
Cache synchronously writes entry to data store
Return

Application code:
set_user(12345, {""foo"":""bar""})
Cache code:
def set_user(user_id, values):
    user = db.query(""UPDATE Users WHERE id = {0}"", user_id, values)
    cache.set(user_id, user)
Write-through is a slow overall operation due to the write operation, but subsequent reads of just written data are fast.  Users are generally more tolerant of latency when updating data than reading data.  Data in the cache is not stale.
Disadvantage(s): write through

When a new node is created due to failure or scaling, the new node will not cache entries until the entry is updated in the database.  Cache-aside in conjunction with write through can mitigate this issue.
Most data written might never be read, which can be minimized with a TTL.

Write-behind (write-back)



Source: Scalability, availability, stability, patterns

In write-behind, the application does the following:

Add/update entry in cache
Asynchronously write entry to the data store, improving write performance

Disadvantage(s): write-behind

There could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store.
It is more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through.

Refresh-ahead



Source: From cache to in-memory data grid

You can configure the cache to automatically refresh any recently accessed cache entry prior to its expiration.
Refresh-ahead can result in reduced latency vs read-through if the cache can accurately predict which items are likely to be needed in the future.
Disadvantage(s): refresh-ahead

Not accurately predicting which items are likely to be needed in the future can result in reduced performance than without refresh-ahead.

Disadvantage(s): cache

Need to maintain consistency between caches and the source of truth such as the database through cache invalidation.
Cache invalidation is a difficult problem, there is additional complexity associated with when to update the cache.
Need to make application changes such as adding Redis or memcached.

Asynchronism



Source: Intro to architecting systems for scale

Asynchronous workflows help reduce request times for expensive operations that would otherwise be performed in-line.  They can also help by doing time-consuming work in advance, such as periodic aggregation of data.
Message queues
Message queues receive, hold, and deliver messages.  If an operation is too slow to perform inline, you can use a message queue with the following workflow:

An application publishes a job to the queue, then notifies the user of job status
A worker picks up the job from the queue, processes it, then signals the job is complete

The user is not blocked and the job is processed in the background.  During this time, the client might optionally do a small amount of processing to make it seem like the task has completed.  For example, if posting a tweet, the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline, but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers.
Redis is useful as a simple message broker but messages can be lost.
RabbitMQ is popular but requires you to adapt to the 'AMQP' protocol and manage your own nodes.
Amazon SQS is hosted but can have high latency and has the possibility of messages being delivered twice.
Task queues
Tasks queues receive tasks and their related data, runs them, then delivers their results.  They can support scheduling and can be used to run computationally-intensive jobs in the background.
Celery has support for scheduling and primarily has python support.
Back pressure
If queues start to grow significantly, the queue size can become larger than memory, resulting in cache misses, disk reads, and even slower performance.  Back pressure can help by limiting the queue size, thereby maintaining a high throughput rate and good response times for jobs already in the queue.  Once the queue fills up, clients get a server busy or HTTP 503 status code to try again later.  Clients can retry the request at a later time, perhaps with exponential backoff.
Disadvantage(s): asynchronism

Use cases such as inexpensive calculations and realtime workflows might be better suited for synchronous operations, as introducing queues can add delays and complexity.

Communication



Source: OSI 7 layer model

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
HTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server.  It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request.  HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.
A basic HTTP request consists of a verb (method) and a resource (endpoint).  Below are common HTTP verbs:



Verb
Description
Idempotent*
Safe
Cacheable




GET
Reads a resource
Yes
Yes
Yes


POST
Creates a resource or trigger a process that handles data
No
No
Yes if response contains freshness info


PUT

Yes
No
No


PATCH
Partially updates a resource
No
No
Yes if response contains freshness info


DELETE
Deletes a resource
Yes
No

*Can be called many times without different outcomes.
HTTP is an application layer protocol relying on lower-level protocols such as TCP and UDP.

Transmission control protocol (TCP)



Source: How to make a multiplayer game

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol over an IP network.  Connection is established and terminated using a handshake.  All packets sent are guaranteed to reach the destination in the original order and without corruption through:

Sequence numbers and checksum fields for each packet
Acknowledgement packets and automatic retransmission

If the sender does not receive a correct response, it will resend the packets.  If there are multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped.  TCP also implements flow control and congestion control.  These guarantees cause delays and generally result in less efficient transmission than UDP.
To ensure high throughput, web servers can keep a large number of TCP connections open, resulting in high memory usage.  It can be expensive to have a large number of open connections between web server threads and say, a memcached server.  Connection pooling can help in addition to switching to UDP where applicable.
TCP is useful for applications that require high reliability but are less time critical.  Some examples include web servers, database info, SMTP, FTP, and SSH.
Use TCP over UDP when:

You need all of the data to arrive intact
You want to automatically make a best estimate use of the network throughput

User datagram protocol (UDP)



Source: How to make a multiplayer game

UDP is connectionless.  Datagrams (analogous to packets) are guaranteed only at the datagram level.  Datagrams might reach their destination out of order or not at all.  UDP does not support congestion control.  Without the guarantees that TCP support, UDP is generally more efficient.
UDP can broadcast, sending datagrams to all devices on the subnet.  This is useful with DHCP because the client has not yet received an IP address, thus preventing a way for TCP to stream without the IP address.
UDP is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, streaming, and realtime multiplayer games.
Use UDP over TCP when:

You need the lowest latency
Late data is worse than loss of data
You want to implement your own error correction

Remote procedure call (RPC)



Source: Crack the system design interview

In an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server.  The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program.  Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls.  Popular RPC frameworks include Protobuf, Thrift, and Avro.
RPC is a request-response protocol:

Client program - Calls the client stub procedure.  The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.
Client stub procedure - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.
Client communication module - OS sends the message from the client to the server.
Server communication module - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.
Server stub procedure -  Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.
The server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.

Sample RPC calls:
GET /someoperation?data=anId

POST /anotheroperation
{
  ""data"":""anId"";
  ""anotherdata"": ""another value""
}

RPC is focused on exposing behaviors.  RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.
Choose a native library (aka SDK) when:

You know your target platform.
You want to control how your ""logic"" is accessed.
You want to control how error control happens off your library.
Performance and end user experience is your primary concern.

HTTP APIs following REST tend to be used more often for public APIs.
Disadvantage(s): RPC

RPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.
A new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.
It can be difficult to debug RPC.
You might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box.  For example, it might require additional effort to ensure RPC calls are properly cached on caching servers such as Squid.

Representational state transfer (REST)
REST is an architectural style enforcing a client/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server.  The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources.  All communication must be stateless and cacheable.
There are four qualities of a RESTful interface:

Identify resources (URI in HTTP) - use the same URI regardless of any operation.
Change with representations (Verbs in HTTP) - use verbs, headers, and body.
Self-descriptive error message (status response in HTTP) - Use status codes, don't reinvent the wheel.
HATEOAS (HTML interface for HTTP) - your web service should be fully accessible in a browser.

Sample REST calls:
GET /someresources/anId

PUT /someresources/anId
{""anotherdata"": ""another value""}

REST is focused on exposing data.  It minimizes the coupling between client/server and is often used for public HTTP APIs.  REST uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through URIs, representation through headers, and actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.  Being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning.
Disadvantage(s): REST

With REST being focused on exposing data, it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy.  For example, returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path.  With REST, it is likely to be implemented with a combination of URI path, query parameters, and possibly the request body.
REST typically relies on a few verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) which sometimes doesn't fit your use case.  For example, moving expired documents to the archive folder might not cleanly fit within these verbs.
Fetching complicated resources with nested hierarchies requires multiple round trips between the client and server to render single views, e.g. fetching content of a blog entry and the comments on that entry. For mobile applications operating in variable network conditions, these multiple roundtrips are highly undesirable.
Over time, more fields might be added to an API response and older clients will receive all new data fields, even those that they do not need, as a result, it bloats the payload size and leads to larger latencies.

Security
This section could use some updates.  Consider contributing!
Security is a broad topic.  Unless you have considerable experience, a security background, or are applying for a position that requires knowledge of security, you probably won't need to know more than the basics:

Encrypt in transit and at rest.
Sanitize all user inputs or any input parameters exposed to user to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Use the principle of least privilege.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. For
more information on using Node.js, see the Node.js Website.
The Node.js project uses an open governance model. The
Node.js Foundation provides support for the project.
This project is bound by a Code of Conduct.

Support
Node.js contributors have limited availability to address general support
questions. Please make sure you are using a currently-supported version of
Node.js.
When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

Node.js Website
Node.js Help
Open or closed issues in the Node.js GitHub organization

If you didn't find an answer in the resources above, try these unofficial
resources:

Questions tagged 'node.js' on StackOverflow
#node.js channel on chat.freenode.net
Node.js Slack Community

To register: nodeslackers.com



GitHub issues are for tracking enhancements and bugs, not general support.
The open source license grants you the freedom to use Node.js. It does not
guarantee commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful and manage
your expectations.
Release Types

Current: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the
branch for its major version number (for example,
v10.x). Node.js releases a new
major version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in
April and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support
life of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)
each October.
LTS: Releases that receive Long-term Support, with a focus on stability
and security. Every even-numbered major version will become an LTS release.
LTS releases receive 18 months of Active LTS support and a further 12 months
of Maintenance. LTS release lines have alphabetically-ordered codenames,
beginning with v4 Argon. There are no breaking changes or feature additions,
except in some special circumstances.
Nightly: Code from the Current branch built every 24-hours when there are
changes. Use with caution.

Current and LTS releases follow Semantic Versioning. A
member of the Release Team signs each Current and LTS release.
For more information, see the
Release README.
Download
Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
Current and LTS Releases
https://nodejs.org/download/release/
The latest directory is an
alias for the latest Current release. The latest-codename directory is an
alias for the latest release from an LTS line. For example, the
latest-carbon directory
contains the latest Carbon (Node.js 8) release.
Nightly Releases
https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/
Each directory name and filename contains a date (in UTC time) and the commit
SHA at the HEAD of the release.
API Documentation
Documentation for the latest Current release is at https://nodejs.org/api/.
Version-specific documentation is available in each release directory in the
docs subdirectory. Version-specific documentation is also at
https://nodejs.org/download/docs/.
Verifying Binaries
Download directories contain a SHASUMS256.txt file with SHA checksums for the
files.
To download SHASUMS256.txt using curl:
$ curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt
To check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, run
it through sha256sum with a command such as:
$ grep node-vx.y.z.tar.gz SHASUMS256.txt | sha256sum -c -
For Current and LTS, the GPG detached signature of SHASUMS256.txt is in
SHASUMS256.txt.sig. You can use it with gpg to verify the integrity of
SHASUM256.txt. You will first need to import
the GPG keys of individuals authorized to create releases. To
import the keys:
$ gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys DD8F2338BAE7501E3DD5AC78C273792F7D83545D
See the bottom of this README for a full script to import active release keys.
Next, download the SHASUMS256.txt.sig for the release:
$ curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt.sig
Then use gpg --verify SHASUMS256.txt.sig SHASUMS256.txt to verify
the file's signature.

Version 5 – the iconic SVG, font, and CSS framework

The internet's most popular icon toolkit has been redesigned and built from
scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework,
official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to
a new CDN.

more about our
successful Kickstarter and plan. You can also order Font Awesome
Pro which includes tons more icons directly
from fontawesome.com.

Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?
Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don't plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.
Documentation is still available but it's moved to
https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0 and
https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1.
The Git repository for
v4.7.0 and
v3.2.1 can
be found in our GitHub releases.
Change log
We'll keep track of each release in the CHANGELOG.md
Looking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the releases.
Upgrading
From time-to-time we'll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.
Check out the UPGRADING.md guide when you upgrade your dependencies.
Code of conduct
We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
Contributing
Please read through our contributing guidelines.  Included
are directions for opening issues.
Versioning
Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.
The major version ""5"" is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:

Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
icon
We will never intentionally release a patch version update that breaks
backward compatibility
A minor release may include backward-incompatible changes but we will
write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
A minor or patch release will never remove icons
Bug fixes will be addressed as patch releases unless they include backward
incompatibility then they will be minor releases

License
Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

Icons — CC BY 4.0 License

In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.


Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License

AngularJS 
AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser.  It lets you
use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade/Pug and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s
syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.  It automatically
synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches
the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.
It also helps with server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferred objects,
and it makes client-side navigation and deep linking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a
piece of cake. Best of all? It makes development fun!

What to use AngularJS for and when to use it
AngularJS is the next generation framework where each component is designed to work with every other
component in an interconnected way like a well-oiled machine. AngularJS is JavaScript MVC made easy
and done right. (Well it is not really MVC, read on, to understand what this means.)
MVC, no, MV* done the right way!
MVC, short for Model-View-Controller, is a design pattern, i.e. how the code should be organized and
how the different parts of an application separated for proper readability and debugging. Model is
the data and the database. View is the user interface and what the user sees. Controller is the main
link between Model and View. These are the three pillars of major programming frameworks present on
the market today. On the other hand AngularJS works on MV*, short for Model-View-Whatever. The
Whatever is AngularJS's way of telling that you may create any kind of linking between the Model
and the View here.
Unlike other frameworks in any programming language, where MVC, the three separate components, each
one has to be written and then connected by the programmer, AngularJS helps the programmer by asking
him/her to just create these and everything else will be taken care of by AngularJS.
Interconnection with HTML at the root level
AngularJS uses HTML to define the user's interface. AngularJS also enables the programmer to write
new HTML tags (AngularJS Directives) and increase the readability and understandability of the HTML
code. Directives are AngularJS’s way of bringing additional functionality to HTML. Directives
achieve this by enabling us to invent our own HTML elements. This also helps in making the code DRY
(Don't Repeat Yourself), which means once created, a new directive can be used anywhere within the
application.
HTML is also used to determine the wiring of the app. Special attributes in the HTML determine where
to load the app, which components or controllers to use for each element, etc. We specify ""what""
gets loaded, but not ""how"". This declarative approach greatly simplifies app development in a sort
of WYSIWYG way. Rather than spending time on how the program flows and orchestrating the various
moving parts, we simply define what we want and AngularJS will take care of the dependencies.
Data Handling made simple
Data and Data Models in AngularJS are plain JavaScript objects and one can add and change properties
directly on it and loop over objects and arrays at will.
Two-way Data Binding
One of AngularJS's strongest features. Two-way Data Binding means that if something changes in the
Model, the change gets reflected in the View instantaneously, and the same happens the other way
around. This is also referred to as Reactive Programming, i.e. suppose a = b + c is being
programmed and after this, if the value of b and/or c is changed then the value of a will be
automatically updated to reflect the change. AngularJS uses its ""scopes"" as a glue between the Model
and View and makes these updates in one available for the other.
Less Written Code and Easily Maintainable Code
Everything in AngularJS is created to enable the programmer to end up writing less code that is
easily maintainable and readable by any other new person on the team. Believe it or not, one can
write a complete working two-way data binded application in less than 10 lines of code. Try and see
for yourself!
Testing Ready
AngularJS has Dependency Injection, i.e. it takes care of providing all the necessary dependencies
to its controllers and services whenever required. This helps in making the AngularJS code ready for
unit testing by making use of mock dependencies created and injected. This makes AngularJS more
modular and easily testable thus in turn helping a team create more robust applications.

Animate.css      
Just-add-water CSS animation
animate.css is a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations for you to use in your projects. Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and general just-add-water-awesomeness.
Installation
Install via npm:
$ npm install animate.css --save
or yarn:
$ yarn add animate.css
Usage
To use animate.css in your website, simply drop the stylesheet into your document's <head>, and add the class animated to an element, along with any of the animation names. That's it! You've got a CSS animated element. Super!
<head>
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""animate.min.css"">
</head>
or use a CDN hosted version by CDNJS
<head>
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.7.0/animate.min.css"">
</head>
Animations
To animate an element, add the class animated to an element. You can include the class infinite for an infinite loop. Finally you need to add one of the following classes to the element:



Class Name







bounce
flash
pulse
rubberBand


shake
headShake
swing
tada


wobble

Full example:
<h1 class=""animated infinite bounce delay-2s"">Example</h1>
Check out all the animations here!
It's possible to change the duration of your animations, add a delay or change the number of times that it plays:
.yourElement {
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-delay: 2s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
Usage with Javascript
You can do a whole bunch of other stuff with animate.css when you combine it with Javascript. A simple example:
const element =  document.querySelector('.my-element')
element.classList.add('animated', 'bounceOutLeft')
You can also detect when an animation ends:
const element =  document.querySelector('.my-element')
element.classList.add('animated', 'bounceOutLeft')

element.addEventListener('animationend', function() { doSomething() })
You can use this simple function to add and remove the animations:
function animateCSS(element, animationName, callback) {
    const node = document.querySelector(element)
    node.classList.add('animated', animationName)

    function handleAnimationEnd() {
        node.classList.remove('animated', animationName)
        node.removeEventListener('animationend', handleAnimationEnd)

        if (typeof callback === 'function') callback()
    }

    node.addEventListener('animationend', handleAnimationEnd)
}
And use it like this:
animateCSS('.my-element', 'bounce')

// or
animateCSS('.my-element', 'bounce', function() {
  // Do something after animation
})
Notice that the examples are using ES6's const declaration, dropping support for IE10 and some aging browsers. If you prefer, switch the const to var declarations and IE10 and some old browsers will get support (they still have to provide classList support, so do your research).
Setting Delay and Speed
Delay Class
It's possible to add delays directly on the element's class attribute, just like this:
<div class=""animated bounce delay-2s"">Example</div>



Class Name
Delay Time




delay-2s
2s


delay-3s
3s


delay-4s
4s


delay-5s
5s




Note: The default delays are from 1 second to 5 seconds only. If you need custom delays, add it directly to your own CSS code.

Slow, Slower, Fast, and Faster Class
It's possible to control the speed of the animation by adding these classes, as a sample below:
<div class=""animated bounce faster"">Example</div>



Class Name
Speed Time




slow
2s


slower
3s


fast
800ms


faster
500ms




Note: The animated class has a default speed of 1s. If you need custom duration, add it directly to your own CSS code.

Custom Builds
Animate.css is powered by gulp.js, which means you can create custom builds pretty easily. First of all, you’ll need Gulp and all other dependencies:
$ cd path/to/animate.css/
$ sudo npm install
Next, run gulp to compile your custom builds. For example, if you want only some of the “attention seekers”, simply edit the animate-config.json file to select only the animations you want to use.
""attention_seekers"": {
  ""bounce"": true,
  ""flash"": false,
  ""pulse"": false,
  ""shake"": true,
  ""headShake"": true,
  ""swing"": true,
  ""tada"": true,
  ""wobble"": true,
  ""jello"":true
}
Accessibility
Animate.css supports the prefers-reduced-motion media query so that users with motion sensitivity can opt out of animations. On supported platforms (currently Firefox, OSX Safari and iOS Safari), users can select ""reduce motion"" on their operating system preferences and it will turn off CSS transitions for them without any further work required.

Installing
Using npm:
$ npm install axios
Using bower:
$ bower install axios
Using yarn:
$ yarn add axios
Using cdn:
<script src=""https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js""></script>
Example
Performing a GET request
const axios = require('axios');

// Make a request for a user with a given ID
axios.get('/user?ID=12345')
  .then(function (response) {
    // handle success
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    // handle error
    console.log(error);
  })
  .finally(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Optionally the request above could also be done as
axios.get('/user', {
    params: {
      ID: 12345
    }
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(function () {
    // always executed
  });  

// Want to use async/await? Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method.
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('/user?ID=12345');
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

NOTE: async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.

Performing a POST request
axios.post('/user', {
    firstName: 'Fred',
    lastName: 'Flintstone'
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
Performing multiple concurrent requests
function getUserAccount() {
  return axios.get('/user/12345');
}

function getUserPermissions() {
  return axios.get('/user/12345/permissions');
}

axios.all([getUserAccount(), getUserPermissions()])
  .then(axios.spread(function (acct, perms) {
    // Both requests are now complete
  }));
axios API
Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to axios.
axios(config)
// Send a POST request
axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: '/user/12345',
  data: {
    firstName: 'Fred',
    lastName: 'Flintstone'
  }
});
// GET request for remote image
axios({
  method: 'get',
  url: 'http://bit.ly/2mTM3nY',
  responseType: 'stream'
})
  .then(function (response) {
    response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('ada_lovelace.jpg'))
  });
axios(url[, config])
// Send a GET request (default method)
axios('/user/12345');
Request method aliases
For convenience aliases have been provided for all supported request methods.
axios.request(config)
axios.get(url[, config])
axios.delete(url[, config])
axios.head(url[, config])
axios.options(url[, config])
axios.post(url[, data[, config]])
axios.put(url[, data[, config]])
axios.patch(url[, data[, config]])
NOTE
When using the alias methods url, method, and data properties don't need to be specified in config.
Concurrency
Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.
axios.all(iterable)
axios.spread(callback)
Creating an instance
You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.
axios.create([config])
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',
  timeout: 1000,
  headers: {'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar'}
});
Instance methods
The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.
axios#request(config)
axios#get(url[, config])
axios#delete(url[, config])
axios#head(url[, config])
axios#options(url[, config])
axios#post(url[, data[, config]])
axios#put(url[, data[, config]])
axios#patch(url[, data[, config]])
axios#getUri([config])
Request Config
These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
{
  // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
  url: '/user',

  // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
  method: 'get', // default

  // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` unless `url` is absolute.
  // It can be convenient to set `baseURL` for an instance of axios to pass relative URLs
  // to methods of that instance.
  baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',

  // `transformRequest` allows changes to the request data before it is sent to the server
  // This is only applicable for request methods 'PUT', 'POST', and 'PATCH'
  // The last function in the array must return a string or an instance of Buffer, ArrayBuffer,
  // FormData or Stream
  // You may modify the headers object.
  transformRequest: [function (data, headers) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `transformResponse` allows changes to the response data to be made before
  // it is passed to then/catch
  transformResponse: [function (data) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `headers` are custom headers to be sent
  headers: {'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'},

  // `params` are the URL parameters to be sent with the request
  // Must be a plain object or a URLSearchParams object
  params: {
    ID: 12345
  },

  // `paramsSerializer` is an optional function in charge of serializing `params`
  // (e.g. https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.param/)
  paramsSerializer: function (params) {
    return Qs.stringify(params, {arrayFormat: 'brackets'})
  },

  // `data` is the data to be sent as the request body
  // Only applicable for request methods 'PUT', 'POST', and 'PATCH'
  // When no `transformRequest` is set, must be of one of the following types:
  // - string, plain object, ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, URLSearchParams
  // - Browser only: FormData, File, Blob
  // - Node only: Stream, Buffer
  data: {
    firstName: 'Fred'
  },

  // `timeout` specifies the number of milliseconds before the request times out.
  // If the request takes longer than `timeout`, the request will be aborted.
  timeout: 1000, // default is `0` (no timeout)

  // `withCredentials` indicates whether or not cross-site Access-Control requests
  // should be made using credentials
  withCredentials: false, // default

  // `adapter` allows custom handling of requests which makes testing easier.
  // Return a promise and supply a valid response (see lib/adapters/README.md).
  adapter: function (config) {
    /* ... */
  },

  // `auth` indicates that HTTP Basic auth should be used, and supplies credentials.
  // This will set an `Authorization` header, overwriting any existing
  // `Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`.
  auth: {
    username: 'janedoe',
    password: 's00pers3cret'
  },

  // `responseType` indicates the type of data that the server will respond with
  // options are: 'arraybuffer', 'document', 'json', 'text', 'stream'
  //   browser only: 'blob'
  responseType: 'json', // default

  // `responseEncoding` indicates encoding to use for decoding responses
  // Note: Ignored for `responseType` of 'stream' or client-side requests
  responseEncoding: 'utf8', // default

  // `xsrfCookieName` is the name of the cookie to use as a value for xsrf token
  xsrfCookieName: 'XSRF-TOKEN', // default

  // `xsrfHeaderName` is the name of the http header that carries the xsrf token value
  xsrfHeaderName: 'X-XSRF-TOKEN', // default

  // `onUploadProgress` allows handling of progress events for uploads
  onUploadProgress: function (progressEvent) {
    // Do whatever you want with the native progress event
  },

  // `onDownloadProgress` allows handling of progress events for downloads
  onDownloadProgress: function (progressEvent) {
    // Do whatever you want with the native progress event
  },

  // `maxContentLength` defines the max size of the http response content in bytes allowed
  maxContentLength: 2000,

  // `validateStatus` defines whether to resolve or reject the promise for a given
  // HTTP response status code. If `validateStatus` returns `true` (or is set to `null`
  // or `undefined`), the promise will be resolved; otherwise, the promise will be
  // rejected.
  validateStatus: function (status) {
    return status >= 200 && status < 300; // default
  },

  // `maxRedirects` defines the maximum number of redirects to follow in node.js.
  // If set to 0, no redirects will be followed.
  maxRedirects: 5, // default

  // `socketPath` defines a UNIX Socket to be used in node.js.
  // e.g. '/var/run/docker.sock' to send requests to the docker daemon.
  // Only either `socketPath` or `proxy` can be specified.
  // If both are specified, `socketPath` is used.
  socketPath: null, // default

  // `httpAgent` and `httpsAgent` define a custom agent to be used when performing http
  // and https requests, respectively, in node.js. This allows options to be added like
  // `keepAlive` that are not enabled by default.
  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),
  httpsAgent: new https.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),

  // 'proxy' defines the hostname and port of the proxy server.
  // You can also define your proxy using the conventional `http_proxy` and
  // `https_proxy` environment variables. If you are using environment variables
  // for your proxy configuration, you can also define a `no_proxy` environment
  // variable as a comma-separated list of domains that should not be proxied.
  // Use `false` to disable proxies, ignoring environment variables.
  // `auth` indicates that HTTP Basic auth should be used to connect to the proxy, and
  // supplies credentials.
  // This will set an `Proxy-Authorization` header, overwriting any existing
  // `Proxy-Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`.
  proxy: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 9000,
    auth: {
      username: 'mikeymike',
      password: 'rapunz3l'
    }
  },

  // `cancelToken` specifies a cancel token that can be used to cancel the request
  // (see Cancellation section below for details)
  cancelToken: new CancelToken(function (cancel) {
  })
}
Response Schema
The response for a request contains the following information.
{
  // `data` is the response that was provided by the server
  data: {},

  // `status` is the HTTP status code from the server response
  status: 200,

  // `statusText` is the HTTP status message from the server response
  statusText: 'OK',

  // `headers` the headers that the server responded with
  // All header names are lower cased
  headers: {},

  // `config` is the config that was provided to `axios` for the request
  config: {},

  // `request` is the request that generated this response
  // It is the last ClientRequest instance in node.js (in redirects)
  // and an XMLHttpRequest instance the browser
  request: {}
}
When using then, you will receive the response as follows:
axios.get('/user/12345')
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response.data);
    console.log(response.status);
    console.log(response.statusText);
    console.log(response.headers);
    console.log(response.config);
  });
When using catch, or passing a rejection callback as second parameter of then, the response will be available through the error object as explained in the Handling Errors section.
Config Defaults
You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.
Global axios defaults
axios.defaults.baseURL = 'https://api.example.com';
axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = AUTH_TOKEN;
axios.defaults.headers.post['Content-Type'] = 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded';
Custom instance defaults
// Set config defaults when creating the instance
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com'
});

// Alter defaults after instance has been created
instance.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = AUTH_TOKEN;
Config order of precedence
Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in lib/defaults.js, then defaults property of the instance, and finally config argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.
// Create an instance using the config defaults provided by the library
// At this point the timeout config value is `0` as is the default for the library
const instance = axios.create();

// Override timeout default for the library
// Now all requests using this instance will wait 2.5 seconds before timing out
instance.defaults.timeout = 2500;

// Override timeout for this request as it's known to take a long time
instance.get('/longRequest', {
  timeout: 5000
});
Interceptors
You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.
// Add a request interceptor
axios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {
    // Do something before request is sent
    return config;
  }, function (error) {
    // Do something with request error
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });

// Add a response interceptor
axios.interceptors.response.use(function (response) {
    // Do something with response data
    return response;
  }, function (error) {
    // Do something with response error
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });
If you may need to remove an interceptor later you can.
const myInterceptor = axios.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
axios.interceptors.request.eject(myInterceptor);
You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.
const instance = axios.create();
instance.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
Handling Errors
axios.get('/user/12345')
  .catch(function (error) {
    if (error.response) {
      // The request was made and the server responded with a status code
      // that falls out of the range of 2xx
      console.log(error.response.data);
      console.log(error.response.status);
      console.log(error.response.headers);
    } else if (error.request) {
      // The request was made but no response was received
      // `error.request` is an instance of XMLHttpRequest in the browser and an instance of
      // http.ClientRequest in node.js
      console.log(error.request);
    } else {
      // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error
      console.log('Error', error.message);
    }
    console.log(error.config);
  });
You can define a custom HTTP status code error range using the validateStatus config option.
axios.get('/user/12345', {
  validateStatus: function (status) {
    return status < 500; // Reject only if the status code is greater than or equal to 500
  }
})
Cancellation
You can cancel a request using a cancel token.

The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancelable promises proposal.

You can create a cancel token using the CancelToken.source factory as shown below:
const CancelToken = axios.CancelToken;
const source = CancelToken.source();

axios.get('/user/12345', {
  cancelToken: source.token
}).catch(function (thrown) {
  if (axios.isCancel(thrown)) {
    console.log('Request canceled', thrown.message);
  } else {
    // handle error
  }
});

axios.post('/user/12345', {
  name: 'new name'
}, {
  cancelToken: source.token
})

// cancel the request (the message parameter is optional)
source.cancel('Operation canceled by the user.');
You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the CancelToken constructor:
const CancelToken = axios.CancelToken;
let cancel;

axios.get('/user/12345', {
  cancelToken: new CancelToken(function executor(c) {
    // An executor function receives a cancel function as a parameter
    cancel = c;
  })
});

// cancel the request
cancel();

Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token.

Using application/x-www-form-urlencoded format
By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to JSON. To send data in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format instead, you can use one of the following options.
Browser
In a browser, you can use the URLSearchParams API as follows:
const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.append('param1', 'value1');
params.append('param2', 'value2');
axios.post('/foo', params);

Note that URLSearchParams is not supported by all browsers (see caniuse.com), but there is a polyfill available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).

Alternatively, you can encode data using the qs library:
const qs = require('qs');
axios.post('/foo', qs.stringify({ 'bar': 123 }));
Or in another way (ES6),
import qs from 'qs';
const data = { 'bar': 123 };
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
  data: qs.stringify(data),
  url,
};
axios(options);
Node.js
In node.js, you can use the querystring module as follows:
const querystring = require('querystring');
axios.post('http://something.com/', querystring.stringify({ foo: 'bar' }));
You can also use the qs library.
NOTE
The qs library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the querystring method has known issues with that use case (https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/1665).
Semver
Until axios reaches a 1.0 release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example 0.5.1, and 0.5.4 will have the same API, but 0.6.0 will have breaking changes.
Promises
axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be supported.
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can polyfill.
TypeScript
axios includes TypeScript definitions.
import axios from 'axios';
axios.get('/user?ID=12345');

The Moby Project

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization.
It provides a ""Lego set"" of toolkit components, the framework for assembling them into custom container-based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts and professionals to experiment and exchange ideas.
Components include container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, a runtime and more, and these can be used as building blocks in conjunction with other tools and projects.
Principles
Moby is an open project guided by strong principles, aiming to be modular, flexible and without too strong an opinion on user experience.
It is open to the community to help set its direction.

Modular: the project includes lots of components that have well-defined functions and APIs that work together.
Batteries included but swappable: Moby includes enough components to build fully featured container system, but its modular architecture ensures that most of the components can be swapped by different implementations.
Usable security: Moby provides secure defaults without compromising usability.
Developer focused: The APIs are intended to be functional and useful to build powerful tools.
They are not necessarily intended as end user tools but as components aimed at developers.
Documentation and UX is aimed at developers not end users.

Audience
The Moby Project is intended for engineers, integrators and enthusiasts looking to modify, hack, fix, experiment, invent and build systems based on containers.
It is not for people looking for a commercially supported system, but for people who want to work and learn with open source code.
Relationship with Docker
The components and tools in the Moby Project are initially the open source components that Docker and the community have built for the Docker Project.
New projects can be added if they fit with the community goals. Docker is committed to using Moby as the upstream for the Docker Product.
However, other projects are also encouraged to use Moby as an upstream, and to reuse the components in diverse ways, and all these uses will be treated in the same way. External maintainers and contributors are welcomed.
The Moby project is not intended as a location for support or feature requests for Docker products, but as a place for contributors to work on open source code, fix bugs, and make the code more useful.
The releases are supported by the maintainers, community and users, on a best efforts basis only, and are not intended for customers who want enterprise or commercial support; Docker EE is the appropriate product for these use cases.

Legal
Brought to you courtesy of our legal counsel. For more context,
please see the NOTICE document in this repo.
Use and transfer of Moby may be subject to certain restrictions by the
United States and other governments.
It is your responsibility to ensure that your use and/or transfer does not
violate applicable laws.
For more information, please see https://www.bis.doc.gov

TensorFlow Models
This repository contains a number of different models implemented in TensorFlow:
The official models are a collection of example models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs. They are intended to be well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable TensorFlow API. They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read. We especially recommend newer TensorFlow users to start here.
The research models are a large collection of models implemented in TensorFlow by researchers. They are not officially supported or available in release branches; it is up to the individual researchers to maintain the models and/or provide support on issues and pull requests.
The samples folder contains code snippets and smaller models that demonstrate features of TensorFlow, including code presented in various blog posts.
The tutorials folder is a collection of models described in the TensorFlow tutorials.

jQuery — New Wave JavaScript


Contribution Guides
In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

Core Style Guide
Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects

Environments in which to use jQuery

Browser support
jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.

What you need to build your own jQuery
To build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.
For Windows, you have to download and install git and Node.js.
OS X users should install Homebrew. Once Homebrew is installed, run brew install git to install git,
and brew install node to install Node.js.
Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.
How to build your own jQuery
Clone a copy of the main jQuery git repo by running:
git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git
Enter the jquery directory and run the build script:
cd jquery && npm run build
The built version of jQuery will be put in the dist/ subdirectory, along with the minified copy and associated map file.
If you want to create custom build or help with jQuery development, it would be better to install grunt command line interface as a global package:
npm install -g grunt-cli

Make sure you have grunt installed by testing:
grunt -V

Now by running the grunt command, in the jquery directory, you can build a full version of jQuery, just like with an npm run build command:
grunt

There are many other tasks available for jQuery Core:
grunt -help

Modules
Special builds can be created that exclude subsets of jQuery functionality.
This allows for smaller custom builds when the builder is certain that those parts of jQuery are not being used.
For example, an app that only used JSONP for $.ajax() and did not need to calculate offsets or positions of elements could exclude the offset and ajax/xhr modules.
Any module may be excluded except for core, and selector. To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the src folder (without the .js extension).
Some example modules that can be excluded are:

ajax: All AJAX functionality: $.ajax(), $.get(), $.post(), $.ajaxSetup(), .load(), transports, and ajax event shorthands such as .ajaxStart().
ajax/xhr: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.
ajax/script: The <script> AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.
ajax/jsonp: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.
css: The .css() method. Also removes all modules depending on css (including effects, dimensions, and offset).
css/showHide:  Non-animated .show(), .hide() and .toggle(); can be excluded if you use classes or explicit .css() calls to set the display property. Also removes the effects module.
deprecated: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.
dimensions: The .width() and .height() methods, including inner- and outer- variations.
effects: The .animate() method and its shorthands such as .slideUp() or .hide(""slow"").
event: The .on() and .off() methods and all event functionality. Also removes event/alias.
event/alias: All event attaching/triggering shorthands like .click() or .mouseover().
event/trigger: The .trigger() and .triggerHandler() methods. Used by the alias module.
offset: The .offset(), .position(), .offsetParent(), .scrollLeft(), and .scrollTop() methods.
wrap: The .wrap(), .wrapAll(), .wrapInner(), and .unwrap() methods.
core/ready: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with jQuery() will simply be called immediately. However, jQuery(document).ready() will not be a function and .on(""ready"", ...) or similar will not be triggered.
deferred: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also removes jQuery.Callbacks. Note that modules that depend on jQuery.Deferred(AJAX, effects, core/ready) will not be removed and will still expect jQuery.Deferred to be there. Include your own jQuery.Deferred implementation or exclude those modules as well (grunt custom:-deferred,-ajax,-effects,-core/ready).
exports/global: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.
exports/amd: Exclude the AMD definition.

As a special case, you may also replace Sizzle by using a special flag grunt custom:-sizzle.

sizzle: The Sizzle selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced by a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser's querySelectorAll method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the selector-native.js file for details.

Note: Excluding Sizzle will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as effects/animatedSelector and css/hiddenVisibleSelectors).
The build process shows a message for each dependent module it excludes or includes.
AMD name
As an option, you can set the module name for jQuery's AMD definition. By default, it is set to ""jquery"", which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you'd like to change this. Simply set the ""amd"" option:
grunt custom --amd=""custom-name""
Or, to define anonymously, set the name to an empty string.
grunt custom --amd=""""
Custom Build Examples
To create a custom build, first check out the version:
git pull; git checkout VERSION
Where VERSION is the version you want to customize. Then, make sure all Node dependencies are installed:
npm install
Create the custom build using the grunt custom option, listing the modules to be excluded.
Exclude all ajax functionality:
grunt custom:-ajax
Excluding css removes modules depending on CSS: effects, offset, dimensions.
grunt custom:-css
Exclude a bunch of modules:
grunt custom:-ajax,-css,-deprecated,-dimensions,-effects,-event/alias,-offset,-wrap
For questions or requests regarding custom builds, please start a thread on the Developing jQuery Core section of the forum. Due to the combinatorics and custom nature of these builds, they are not regularly tested in jQuery's unit test process. The non-Sizzle selector engine currently does not pass unit tests because it is missing too much essential functionality.
Running the Unit Tests
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:
npm install
Start grunt watch or npm start to auto-build jQuery as you work:
grunt watch
Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the ""test"" directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:

Windows: WAMP download
Mac: MAMP download
Linux: Setting up LAMP
Mongoose (most platforms)

Building to a different directory
To copy the built jQuery files from /dist to another directory:
grunt && grunt dist:/path/to/special/location/
With this example, the output files would be:
/path/to/special/location/jquery.js
/path/to/special/location/jquery.min.js
To add a permanent copy destination, create a file in dist/ called "".destination.json"". Inside the file, paste and customize the following:
{
  ""/Absolute/path/to/other/destination"": true
}
Additionally, both methods can be combined.
Essential Git
As the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it's useful to know some features used.
Cleaning
If you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream, the following commands can be used (remember everything you've worked on is gone after these):
git reset --hard upstream/master
git clean -fdx
Rebasing
For feature/topic branches, you should always use the --rebase flag to git pull, or if you are usually handling many temporary ""to be in a github pull request"" branches, run the following to automate this:
git config branch.autosetuprebase local
(see man git-config for more information)
Handling merge conflicts
If you're getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature
git mergetool. Even though the default tool xxdiff looks awful/old, it's rather useful.
The following are some commands that can be used there:

Ctrl + Alt + M - automerge as much as possible
b - jump to next merge conflict
s - change the order of the conflicted lines
u - undo a merge
left mouse button - mark a block to be the winner
middle mouse button - mark a line to be the winner
Ctrl + S - save
Ctrl + Q - quit

QUnit Reference
Test methods
expect( numAssertions );
stop();
start();
Note: QUnit's eventual addition of an argument to stop/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.
Test assertions
ok( value, [message] );
equal( actual, expected, [message] );
notEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
deepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notDeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
strictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
notStrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );
throws( block, [expected], [message] );
Test Suite Convenience Methods Reference (See test/data/testinit.js)
Returns an array of elements with the given IDs
q( ... );
Example:
q(""main"", ""foo"", ""bar"");

=> [ div#main, span#foo, input#bar ]
Asserts that a selection matches the given IDs
t( testName, selector, [ ""array"", ""of"", ""ids"" ] );
Example:
t(""Check for something"", ""//[a]"", [""foo"", ""bar""]);
Fires a native DOM event without going through jQuery
fireNative( node, eventType )
Example:
fireNative( jQuery(""#elem"")[0], ""click"" );
Add random number to url to stop caching
url( ""some/url"" );
Example:
url(""index.html"");

=> ""data/index.html?10538358428943""


url(""mock.php?foo=bar"");

=> ""data/mock.php?foo=bar&10538358345554""
Run tests in an iframe
Some tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and
these can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions
remain in jQuery's main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup
and setup code should be placed in the iframe file.
testIframe( testName, fileName,
  function testCallback(
      assert, jQuery, window, document,
	  [ additional args ] ) {
	...
  } );
This loads a page, constructing a url with fileName ""./data/"" + fileName.
The iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by
including the ""/test/data/iframeTest.js"" script and calling
startIframeTest( [ additional args ] ) when appropriate. Often this
will be after either document ready or window.onload fires.
The testCallback receives the QUnit assert object created by testIframe
for this test, followed by the global jQuery, window, and document from
the iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to startIframeTest,
they follow the document argument.
Questions?
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask on the
Developing jQuery Core forum or in #jquery on irc.freenode.net.

JavaScript 3D library
The aim of the project is to create an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library with a default WebGL renderer. The library also provides Canvas 2D, SVG and CSS3D renderers in the examples.

Usage
Download the minified library and include it in your HTML, or install and import it as a module,
Alternatively see how to build the library yourself.
<script src=""js/three.min.js""></script>
This code creates a scene, a camera, and a geometric cube, and it adds the cube to the scene. It then creates a WebGL renderer for the scene and camera, and it adds that viewport to the document.body element. Finally, it animates the cube within the scene for the camera.
var camera, scene, renderer;
var geometry, material, mesh;

init();
animate();

function init() {

	camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.01, 10 );
	camera.position.z = 1;

	scene = new THREE.Scene();

	geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 );
	material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

	mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
	scene.add( mesh );

	renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
	renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
	document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

}

function animate() {

	requestAnimationFrame( animate );

	mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
	mesh.rotation.y += 0.02;

	renderer.render( scene, camera );

}

                                 present, !key to check if the key is not
                                 present, key > NUMBER (like ""comment_count
                                 > 12"", also works with >=, <, <=, !=, =) to
                                 compare against a number, key = 'LITERAL'
                                 (like ""uploader = 'Mike Smith'"", also works
                                 with !=) to match against a string literal
                                 and & to require multiple matches. Values
                                 which are not known are excluded unless you
                                 put a question mark (?) after the operator.
                                 For example, to only match videos that have
                                 been liked more than 100 times and disliked
                                 less than 50 times (or the dislike

--audio-quality QUALITY          Specify ffmpeg/avconv audio quality, insert
                                 a value between 0 (better) and 9 (worse)
                                 for VBR or a specific bitrate like 128K
                                 (default 5)
--recode-video FORMAT            Encode the video to another format if
                                 necessary (currently supported:

                                 syntax is the same as --output. Regular
                                 expression with named capture groups may
                                 also be used. The parsed parameters replace
                                 existing values. Example: --metadata-from-
                                 title ""%(artist)s - %(title)s"" matches a
                                 title like ""Coldplay - Paradise"". Example

                                 /sdcard/Music/ && rm {}'
--convert-subs FORMAT            Convert the subtitles to other format
                                 (currently supported: srt|ass|vtt|lrc)

CONFIGURATION
You can configure youtube-dl by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file. On Linux and macOS, the system wide configuration file is located at /etc/youtube-dl.conf and the user wide configuration file at ~/.config/youtube-dl/config. On Windows, the user wide configuration file locations are %APPDATA%\youtube-dl\config.txt or C:\Users\<user name>\youtube-dl.conf. Note that by default configuration file may not exist so you may need to create it yourself.
For example, with the following configuration file youtube-dl will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under Movies directory in your home directory:
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Always extract audio
-x

# Do not copy the mtime
--no-mtime

# Use this proxy
--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128

# Save all videos under Movies directory in your home directory
-o ~/Movies/%(title)s.%(ext)s

Note that options in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls thus there must be no whitespace after - or --, e.g. -o or --proxy but not - o or -- proxy.
You can use --ignore-config if you want to disable the configuration file for a particular youtube-dl run.
You can also use --config-location if you want to use custom configuration file for a particular youtube-dl run.
Authentication with .netrc file
You may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password with --username and --password) in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every youtube-dl execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. You can achieve this using a .netrc file on a per extractor basis. For that you will need to create a .netrc file in your $HOME and restrict permissions to read/write by only you:
touch $HOME/.netrc
chmod a-rwx,u+rw $HOME/.netrc

After that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where extractor is the name of the extractor in lowercase:
machine <extractor> login <login> password <password>

For example:
machine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password
machine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password

To activate authentication with the .netrc file you should pass --netrc to youtube-dl or place it in the configuration file.
On Windows you may also need to setup the %HOME% environment variable manually. For example:
set HOME=%USERPROFILE%

OUTPUT TEMPLATE
The -o option allows users to indicate a template for the output file names.
tl;dr: navigate me to examples.
The basic usage is not to set any template arguments when downloading a single file, like in youtube-dl -o funny_video.flv ""https://some/video"". However, it may contain special sequences that will be replaced when downloading each video. The special sequences may be formatted according to python string formatting operations. For example, %(NAME)s or %(NAME)05d. To clarify, that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses, followed by formatting operations. Allowed names along with sequence type are:

Each aforementioned sequence when referenced in an output template will be replaced by the actual value corresponding to the sequence name. Note that some of the sequences are not guaranteed to be present since they depend on the metadata obtained by a particular extractor. Such sequences will be replaced with NA.
For example for -o %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s and an mp4 video with title youtube-dl test video and id BaW_jenozKcj, this will result in a youtube-dl test video-BaW_jenozKcj.mp4 file created in the current directory.
For numeric sequences you can use numeric related formatting, for example, %(view_count)05d will result in a string with view count padded with zeros up to 5 characters, like in 00042.
Output templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path, e.g. -o '%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s' which will result in downloading each video in a directory corresponding to this path template. Any missing directory will be automatically created for you.
To use percent literals in an output template use %%. To output to stdout use -o -.
The current default template is %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s.
In some cases, you don't want special characters such as 中, spaces, or &, such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a Windows system or the filename through an 8bit-unsafe channel. In these cases, add the --restrict-filenames flag to get a shorter title:
Output template and Windows batch files
If you are using an output template inside a Windows batch file then you must escape plain percent characters (%) by doubling, so that -o ""%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s"" should become -o ""%%(title)s-%%(id)s.%%(ext)s"". However you should not touch %'s that are not plain characters, e.g. environment variables for expansion should stay intact: -o ""C:\%HOMEPATH%\Desktop\%%(title)s.%%(ext)s"".
Output template examples
Note that on Windows you may need to use double quotes instead of single.
$ youtube-dl --get-filename -o '%(title)s.%(ext)s' BaW_jenozKc
youtube-dl test video ''_ä↭𝕐.mp4    # All kinds of weird characters

$ youtube-dl --get-filename -o '%(title)s.%(ext)s' BaW_jenozKc --restrict-filenames

# Stream the video being downloaded to stdout
$ youtube-dl -o - BaW_jenozKc
FORMAT SELECTION
By default youtube-dl tries to download the best available quality, i.e. if you want the best quality you don't need to pass any special options, youtube-dl will guess it for you by default.
But sometimes you may want to download in a different format, for example when you are on a slow or intermittent connection. The key mechanism for achieving this is so-called format selection based on which you can explicitly specify desired format, select formats based on some criterion or criteria, setup precedence and much more.
The general syntax for format selection is --format FORMAT or shorter -f FORMAT where FORMAT is a selector expression, i.e. an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.
tl;dr: navigate me to examples.
The simplest case is requesting a specific format, for example with -f 22 you can download the format with format code equal to 22. You can get the list of available format codes for particular video using --list-formats or -F. Note that these format codes are extractor specific.
You can also use a file extension (currently 3gp, aac, flv, m4a, mp3, mp4, ogg, wav, webm are supported) to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file, e.g. -f webm will download the best quality format with the webm extension served as a single file.
You can also use special names to select particular edge case formats:

best: Select the best quality format represented by a single file with video and audio.
worst: Select the worst quality format represented by a single file with video and audio.
bestvideo: Select the best quality video-only format (e.g. DASH video). May not be available.
worstvideo: Select the worst quality video-only format. May not be available.
bestaudio: Select the best quality audio only-format. May not be available.
worstaudio: Select the worst quality audio only-format. May not be available.

For example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use -f worstvideo.
If you want to download multiple videos and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes. Note that slash is left-associative, i.e. formats on the left hand side are preferred, for example -f 22/17/18 will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.
If you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as a separator, e.g. -f 22,17,18 will download all these three formats, of course if they are available. Or a more sophisticated example combined with the precedence feature: -f 136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio.
You can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets, as in -f ""best[height=720]"" (or -f ""[filesize>10M]"").
The following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons <, <=, >, >=, = (equals), != (not equals):

filesize: The number of bytes, if known in advance
width: Width of the video, if known
height: Height of the video, if known
tbr: Average bitrate of audio and video in KBit/s
abr: Average audio bitrate in KBit/s
vbr: Average video bitrate in KBit/s
asr: Audio sampling rate in Hertz
fps: Frame rate

Also filtering work for comparisons = (equals), ^= (starts with), $= (ends with), *= (contains) and following string meta fields:

ext: File extension
acodec: Name of the audio codec in use
vcodec: Name of the video codec in use
container: Name of the container format
protocol: The protocol that will be used for the actual download, lower-case (http, https, rtsp, rtmp, rtmpe, mms, f4m, ism, http_dash_segments, m3u8, or m3u8_native)
format_id: A short description of the format

Any string comparison may be prefixed with negation ! in order to produce an opposite comparison, e.g. !*= (does not contain).
Note that none of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be present since this solely depends on the metadata obtained by particular extractor, i.e. the metadata offered by the video hoster.
Formats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark (?) after the operator. You can combine format filters, so -f ""[height <=? 720][tbr>500]"" selects up to 720p videos (or videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500 KBit/s.
You can merge the video and audio of two formats into a single file using -f <video-format>+<audio-format> (requires ffmpeg or avconv installed), for example -f bestvideo+bestaudio will download the best video-only format, the best audio-only format and mux them together with ffmpeg/avconv.
Format selectors can also be grouped using parentheses, for example if you want to download the best mp4 and webm formats with a height lower than 480 you can use -f '(mp4,webm)[height<480]'.
Since the end of April 2015 and version 2015.04.26, youtube-dl uses -f bestvideo+bestaudio/best as the default format selection (see #5447, #5456). If ffmpeg or avconv are installed this results in downloading bestvideo and bestaudio separately and muxing them together into a single file giving the best overall quality available. Otherwise it falls back to best and results in downloading the best available quality served as a single file. best is also needed for videos that don't come from YouTube because they don't provide the audio and video in two different files. If you want to only download some DASH formats (for example if you are not interested in getting videos with a resolution higher than 1080p), you can add -f bestvideo[height<=?1080]+bestaudio/best to your configuration file. Note that if you use youtube-dl to stream to stdout (and most likely to pipe it to your media player then), i.e. you explicitly specify output template as -o -, youtube-dl still uses -f best format selection in order to start content delivery immediately to your player and not to wait until bestvideo and bestaudio are downloaded and muxed.
If you want to preserve the old format selection behavior (prior to youtube-dl 2015.04.26), i.e. you want to download the best available quality media served as a single file, you should explicitly specify your choice with -f best. You may want to add it to the configuration file in order not to type it every time you run youtube-dl.
Format selection examples
Note that on Windows you may need to use double quotes instead of single.
# Download best mp4 format available or any other best if no mp4 available
$ youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best'

# Download best format available but no better than 480p
$ youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[height<=480]+bestaudio/best[height<=480]'

# Download best video only format but no bigger than 50 MB
$ youtube-dl -f 'best[filesize<50M]'

# Download best format available via direct link over HTTP/HTTPS protocol
$ youtube-dl -f '(bestvideo+bestaudio/best)[protocol^=http]'

# Download the best video format and the best audio format without merging them
$ youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo,bestaudio' -o '%(title)s.f%(format_id)s.%(ext)s'
Note that in the last example, an output template is recommended as bestvideo and bestaudio may have the same file name.
VIDEO SELECTION
Videos can be filtered by their upload date using the options --date, --datebefore or --dateafter. They accept dates in two formats:

Absolute dates: Dates in the format YYYYMMDD.
Relative dates: Dates in the format (now|today)[+-][0-9](day|week|month|year)(s)?

Examples:
# Download only the videos uploaded in the last 6 months
$ youtube-dl --dateafter now-6months

# Download only the videos uploaded on January 1, 1970
$ youtube-dl --date 19700101

$ # Download only the videos uploaded in the 200x decade
$ youtube-dl --dateafter 20000101 --datebefore 20091231
FAQ
How do I update youtube-dl?
If you've followed our manual installation instructions, you can simply run youtube-dl -U (or, on Linux, sudo youtube-dl -U).
If you have used pip, a simple sudo pip install -U youtube-dl is sufficient to update.
If you have installed youtube-dl using a package manager like apt-get or yum, use the standard system update mechanism to update. Note that distribution packages are often outdated. As a rule of thumb, youtube-dl releases at least once a month, and often weekly or even daily. Simply go to https://yt-dl.org to find out the current version. Unfortunately, there is nothing we youtube-dl developers can do if your distribution serves a really outdated version. You can (and should) complain to your distribution in their bugtracker or support forum.
As a last resort, you can also uninstall the version installed by your package manager and follow our manual installation instructions. For that, remove the distribution's package, with a line like
sudo apt-get remove -y youtube-dl

Afterwards, simply follow our manual installation instructions:
sudo wget https://yt-dl.org/latest/youtube-dl -O /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
hash -r

Again, from then on you'll be able to update with sudo youtube-dl -U.
youtube-dl is extremely slow to start on Windows
Add a file exclusion for youtube-dl.exe in Windows Defender settings.
I'm getting an error Unable to extract OpenGraph title on YouTube playlists
YouTube changed their playlist format in March 2014 and later on, so you'll need at least youtube-dl 2014.07.25 to download all YouTube videos.
If you have installed youtube-dl with a package manager, pip, setup.py or a tarball, please use that to update. Note that Ubuntu packages do not seem to get updated anymore. Since we are not affiliated with Ubuntu, there is little we can do. Feel free to report bugs to the Ubuntu packaging people - all they have to do is update the package to a somewhat recent version. See above for a way to update.
I'm getting an error when trying to use output template: error: using output template conflicts with using title, video ID or auto number
Make sure you are not using -o with any of these options -t, --title, --id, -A or --auto-number set in command line or in a configuration file. Remove the latter if any.
Do I always have to pass -citw?
By default, youtube-dl intends to have the best options (incidentally, if you have a convincing case that these should be different, please file an issue where you explain that). Therefore, it is unnecessary and sometimes harmful to copy long option strings from webpages. In particular, the only option out of -citw that is regularly useful is -i.
Can you please put the -b option back?
Most people asking this question are not aware that youtube-dl now defaults to downloading the highest available quality as reported by YouTube, which will be 1080p or 720p in some cases, so you no longer need the -b option. For some specific videos, maybe YouTube does not report them to be available in a specific high quality format you're interested in. In that case, simply request it with the -f option and youtube-dl will try to download it.
I get HTTP error 402 when trying to download a video. What's this?
Apparently YouTube requires you to pass a CAPTCHA test if you download too much. We're considering to provide a way to let you solve the CAPTCHA, but at the moment, your best course of action is pointing a web browser to the youtube URL, solving the CAPTCHA, and restart youtube-dl.
Do I need any other programs?
youtube-dl works fine on its own on most sites. However, if you want to convert video/audio, you'll need avconv or ffmpeg. On some sites - most notably YouTube - videos can be retrieved in a higher quality format without sound. youtube-dl will detect whether avconv/ffmpeg is present and automatically pick the best option.
Videos or video formats streamed via RTMP protocol can only be downloaded when rtmpdump is installed. Downloading MMS and RTSP videos requires either mplayer or mpv to be installed.
I have downloaded a video but how can I play it?
Once the video is fully downloaded, use any video player, such as mpv, vlc or mplayer.
I extracted a video URL with -g, but it does not play on another machine / in my web browser.
It depends a lot on the service. In many cases, requests for the video (to download/play it) must come from the same IP address and with the same cookies and/or HTTP headers. Use the --cookies option to write the required cookies into a file, and advise your downloader to read cookies from that file. Some sites also require a common user agent to be used, use --dump-user-agent to see the one in use by youtube-dl. You can also get necessary cookies and HTTP headers from JSON output obtained with --dump-json.
It may be beneficial to use IPv6; in some cases, the restrictions are only applied to IPv4. Some services (sometimes only for a subset of videos) do not restrict the video URL by IP address, cookie, or user-agent, but these are the exception rather than the rule.
Please bear in mind that some URL protocols are not supported by browsers out of the box, including RTMP. If you are using -g, your own downloader must support these as well.
If you want to play the video on a machine that is not running youtube-dl, you can relay the video content from the machine that runs youtube-dl. You can use -o - to let youtube-dl stream a video to stdout, or simply allow the player to download the files written by youtube-dl in turn.
ERROR: no fmt_url_map or conn information found in video info
YouTube has switched to a new video info format in July 2011 which is not supported by old versions of youtube-dl. See above for how to update youtube-dl.
ERROR: unable to download video
YouTube requires an additional signature since September 2012 which is not supported by old versions of youtube-dl. See above for how to update youtube-dl.
Video URL contains an ampersand and I'm getting some strange output [1] 2839 or 'v' is not recognized as an internal or external command
That's actually the output from your shell. Since ampersand is one of the special shell characters it's interpreted by the shell preventing you from passing the whole URL to youtube-dl. To disable your shell from interpreting the ampersands (or any other special characters) you have to either put the whole URL in quotes or escape them with a backslash (which approach will work depends on your shell).
For example if your URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4&v=BaW_jenozKc you should end up with following command:
youtube-dl 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4&v=BaW_jenozKc'
or
youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4\&v=BaW_jenozKc
For Windows you have to use the double quotes:
youtube-dl ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4&v=BaW_jenozKc""
ExtractorError: Could not find JS function u'OF'
In February 2015, the new YouTube player contained a character sequence in a string that was misinterpreted by old versions of youtube-dl. See above for how to update youtube-dl.
HTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests or 402: Payment Required
These two error codes indicate that the service is blocking your IP address because of overuse. Contact the service and ask them to unblock your IP address, or - if you have acquired a whitelisted IP address already - use the --proxy or --source-address options to select another IP address.
SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character
The error
File ""youtube-dl"", line 2
SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\x93' ...

means you're using an outdated version of Python. Please update to Python 2.6 or 2.7.
What is this binary file? Where has the code gone?
Since June 2012 (#342) youtube-dl is packed as an executable zipfile, simply unzip it (might need renaming to youtube-dl.zip first on some systems) or clone the git repository, as laid out above. If you modify the code, you can run it by executing the __main__.py file. To recompile the executable, run make youtube-dl.
The exe throws an error due to missing MSVCR100.dll
To run the exe you need to install first the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86).
On Windows, how should I set up ffmpeg and youtube-dl? Where should I put the exe files?
If you put youtube-dl and ffmpeg in the same directory that you're running the command from, it will work, but that's rather cumbersome.
To make a different directory work - either for ffmpeg, or for youtube-dl, or for both - simply create the directory (say, C:\bin, or C:\Users\<User name>\bin), put all the executables directly in there, and then set your PATH environment variable to include that directory.
From then on, after restarting your shell, you will be able to access both youtube-dl and ffmpeg (and youtube-dl will be able to find ffmpeg) by simply typing youtube-dl or ffmpeg, no matter what directory you're in.
How do I put downloads into a specific folder?
Use the -o to specify an output template, for example -o ""/home/user/videos/%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s"". If you want this for all of your downloads, put the option into your configuration file.
How do I download a video starting with a -?
Either prepend https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= or separate the ID from the options with --:
youtube-dl -- -wNyEUrxzFU
youtube-dl ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wNyEUrxzFU""

How do I pass cookies to youtube-dl?
Use the --cookies option, for example --cookies /path/to/cookies/file.txt.
In order to extract cookies from browser use any conforming browser extension for exporting cookies. For example, cookies.txt (for Chrome) or cookies.txt (for Firefox).
Note that the cookies file must be in Mozilla/Netscape format and the first line of the cookies file must be either # HTTP Cookie File or # Netscape HTTP Cookie File. Make sure you have correct newline format in the cookies file and convert newlines if necessary to correspond with your OS, namely CRLF (\r\n) for Windows and LF (\n) for Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, etc.). HTTP Error 400: Bad Request when using --cookies is a good sign of invalid newline format.
Passing cookies to youtube-dl is a good way to workaround login when a particular extractor does not implement it explicitly. Another use case is working around CAPTCHA some websites require you to solve in particular cases in order to get access (e.g. YouTube, CloudFlare).
How do I stream directly to media player?
You will first need to tell youtube-dl to stream media to stdout with -o -, and also tell your media player to read from stdin (it must be capable of this for streaming) and then pipe former to latter. For example, streaming to vlc can be achieved with:
youtube-dl -o - ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKcj"" | vlc -

How do I download only new videos from a playlist?
Use download-archive feature. With this feature you should initially download the complete playlist with --download-archive /path/to/download/archive/file.txt that will record identifiers of all the videos in a special file. Each subsequent run with the same --download-archive will download only new videos and skip all videos that have been downloaded before. Note that only successful downloads are recorded in the file.
For example, at first,
youtube-dl --download-archive archive.txt ""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re""

will download the complete PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re playlist and create a file archive.txt. Each subsequent run will only download new videos if any:
youtube-dl --download-archive archive.txt ""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re""

Should I add --hls-prefer-native into my config?
When youtube-dl detects an HLS video, it can download it either with the built-in downloader or ffmpeg. Since many HLS streams are slightly invalid and ffmpeg/youtube-dl each handle some invalid cases better than the other, there is an option to switch the downloader if needed.
When youtube-dl knows that one particular downloader works better for a given website, that downloader will be picked. Otherwise, youtube-dl will pick the best downloader for general compatibility, which at the moment happens to be ffmpeg. This choice may change in future versions of youtube-dl, with improvements of the built-in downloader and/or ffmpeg.
In particular, the generic extractor (used when your website is not in the list of supported sites by youtube-dl cannot mandate one specific downloader.
If you put either --hls-prefer-native or --hls-prefer-ffmpeg into your configuration, a different subset of videos will fail to download correctly. Instead, it is much better to file an issue or a pull request which details why the native or the ffmpeg HLS downloader is a better choice for your use case.
Can you add support for this anime video site, or site which shows current movies for free?
As a matter of policy (as well as legality), youtube-dl does not include support for services that specialize in infringing copyright. As a rule of thumb, if you cannot easily find a video that the service is quite obviously allowed to distribute (i.e. that has been uploaded by the creator, the creator's distributor, or is published under a free license), the service is probably unfit for inclusion to youtube-dl.
A note on the service that they don't host the infringing content, but just link to those who do, is evidence that the service should not be included into youtube-dl. The same goes for any DMCA note when the whole front page of the service is filled with videos they are not allowed to distribute. A ""fair use"" note is equally unconvincing if the service shows copyright-protected videos in full without authorization.
Support requests for services that do purchase the rights to distribute their content are perfectly fine though. If in doubt, you can simply include a source that mentions the legitimate purchase of content.
How can I speed up work on my issue?
(Also known as: Help, my important issue not being solved!) The youtube-dl core developer team is quite small. While we do our best to solve as many issues as possible, sometimes that can take quite a while. To speed up your issue, here's what you can do:
First of all, please do report the issue at our issue tracker. That allows us to coordinate all efforts by users and developers, and serves as a unified point. Unfortunately, the youtube-dl project has grown too large to use personal email as an effective communication channel.
Please read the bug reporting instructions below. A lot of bugs lack all the necessary information. If you can, offer proxy, VPN, or shell access to the youtube-dl developers. If you are able to, test the issue from multiple computers in multiple countries to exclude local censorship or misconfiguration issues.
If nobody is interested in solving your issue, you are welcome to take matters into your own hands and submit a pull request (or coerce/pay somebody else to do so).
Feel free to bump the issue from time to time by writing a small comment (""Issue is still present in youtube-dl version ...from France, but fixed from Belgium""), but please not more than once a month. Please do not declare your issue as important or urgent.
How can I detect whether a given URL is supported by youtube-dl?
For one, have a look at the list of supported sites. Note that it can sometimes happen that the site changes its URL scheme (say, from https://example.com/video/1234567 to https://example.com/v/1234567 ) and youtube-dl reports an URL of a service in that list as unsupported. In that case, simply report a bug.
It is not possible to detect whether a URL is supported or not. That's because youtube-dl contains a generic extractor which matches all URLs. You may be tempted to disable, exclude, or remove the generic extractor, but the generic extractor not only allows users to extract videos from lots of websites that embed a video from another service, but may also be used to extract video from a service that it's hosting itself. Therefore, we neither recommend nor support disabling, excluding, or removing the generic extractor.
If you want to find out whether a given URL is supported, simply call youtube-dl with it. If you get no videos back, chances are the URL is either not referring to a video or unsupported. You can find out which by examining the output (if you run youtube-dl on the console) or catching an UnsupportedError exception if you run it from a Python program.
Why do I need to go through that much red tape when filing bugs?
Before we had the issue template, despite our extensive bug reporting instructions, about 80% of the issue reports we got were useless, for instance because people used ancient versions hundreds of releases old, because of simple syntactic errors (not in youtube-dl but in general shell usage), because the problem was already reported multiple times before, because people did not actually read an error message, even if it said ""please install ffmpeg"", because people did not mention the URL they were trying to download and many more simple, easy-to-avoid problems, many of whom were totally unrelated to youtube-dl.
youtube-dl is an open-source project manned by too few volunteers, so we'd rather spend time fixing bugs where we are certain none of those simple problems apply, and where we can be reasonably confident to be able to reproduce the issue without asking the reporter repeatedly. As such, the output of youtube-dl -v YOUR_URL_HERE is really all that's required to file an issue. The issue template also guides you through some basic steps you can do, such as checking that your version of youtube-dl is current.
DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS
Most users do not need to build youtube-dl and can download the builds or get them from their distribution.
To run youtube-dl as a developer, you don't need to build anything either. Simply execute
python -m youtube_dl

To run the test, simply invoke your favorite test runner, or execute a test file directly; any of the following work:
python -m unittest discover
python test/test_download.py
nosetests

See item 6 of new extractor tutorial for how to run extractor specific test cases.
If you want to create a build of youtube-dl yourself, you'll need

python
make (only GNU make is supported)
pandoc
zip
nosetests

Adding support for a new site
If you want to add support for a new site, first of all make sure this site is not dedicated to copyright infringement. youtube-dl does not support such sites thus pull requests adding support for them will be rejected.
After you have ensured this site is distributing its content legally, you can follow this quick list (assuming your service is called yourextractor):


Fork this repository


Check out the source code with:
 git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/youtube-dl.git



Start a new git branch with
 cd youtube-dl
 git checkout -b yourextractor



Start with this simple template and save it to youtube_dl/extractor/yourextractor.py:
# coding: utf-8
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from .common import InfoExtractor


class YourExtractorIE(InfoExtractor):
    _VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\.)?yourextractor\.com/watch/(?P<id>[0-9]+)'
    _TEST = {
        'url': 'https://yourextractor.com/watch/42',
        'md5': 'TODO: md5 sum of the first 10241 bytes of the video file (use --test)',
        'info_dict': {
            'id': '42',
            'ext': 'mp4',
            'title': 'Video title goes here',
            'thumbnail': r're:^https?://.*\.jpg$',
            # TODO more properties, either as:
            # * A value
            # * MD5 checksum; start the string with md5:
            # * A regular expression; start the string with re:
            # * Any Python type (for example int or float)
        }
    }

    def _real_extract(self, url):
        video_id = self._match_id(url)
        webpage = self._download_webpage(url, video_id)

        # TODO more code goes here, for example ...
        title = self._html_search_regex(r'<h1>(.+?)</h1>', webpage, 'title')

        return {
            'id': video_id,
            'title': title,
            'description': self._og_search_description(webpage),
            'uploader': self._search_regex(r'<div[^>]+id=""uploader""[^>]*>([^<]+)<', webpage, 'uploader', fatal=False),
            # TODO more properties (see youtube_dl/extractor/common.py)
        }


Add an import in youtube_dl/extractor/extractors.py.


Run python test/test_download.py TestDownload.test_YourExtractor. This should fail at first, but you can continually re-run it until you're done. If you decide to add more than one test, then rename _TEST to _TESTS and make it into a list of dictionaries. The tests will then be named TestDownload.test_YourExtractor, TestDownload.test_YourExtractor_1, TestDownload.test_YourExtractor_2, etc. Note that tests with only_matching key in test's dict are not counted in.


Have a look at youtube_dl/extractor/common.py for possible helper methods and a detailed description of what your extractor should and may return. Add tests and code for as many as you want.


Make sure your code follows youtube-dl coding conventions and check the code with flake8:
 $ flake8 youtube_dl/extractor/yourextractor.py



Make sure your code works under all Python versions claimed supported by youtube-dl, namely 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2+.


When the tests pass, add the new files and commit them and push the result, like this:
$ git add youtube_dl/extractor/extractors.py
$ git add youtube_dl/extractor/yourextractor.py
$ git commit -m '[yourextractor] Add new extractor'
$ git push origin yourextractor



Finally, create a pull request. We'll then review and merge it.


In any case, thank you very much for your contributions!
youtube-dl coding conventions
This section introduces a guide lines for writing idiomatic, robust and future-proof extractor code.
Extractors are very fragile by nature since they depend on the layout of the source data provided by 3rd party media hosters out of your control and this layout tends to change. As an extractor implementer your task is not only to write code that will extract media links and metadata correctly but also to minimize dependency on the source's layout and even to make the code foresee potential future changes and be ready for that. This is important because it will allow the extractor not to break on minor layout changes thus keeping old youtube-dl versions working. Even though this breakage issue is easily fixed by emitting a new version of youtube-dl with a fix incorporated, all the previous versions become broken in all repositories and distros' packages that may not be so prompt in fetching the update from us. Needless to say, some non rolling release distros may never receive an update at all.
Mandatory and optional metafields
For extraction to work youtube-dl relies on metadata your extractor extracts and provides to youtube-dl expressed by an information dictionary or simply info dict. Only the following meta fields in the info dict are considered mandatory for a successful extraction process by youtube-dl:

id (media identifier)
title (media title)
url (media download URL) or formats

In fact only the last option is technically mandatory (i.e. if you can't figure out the download location of the media the extraction does not make any sense). But by convention youtube-dl also treats id and title as mandatory. Thus the aforementioned metafields are the critical data that the extraction does not make any sense without and if any of them fail to be extracted then the extractor is considered completely broken.
Any field apart from the aforementioned ones are considered optional. That means that extraction should be tolerant to situations when sources for these fields can potentially be unavailable (even if they are always available at the moment) and future-proof in order not to break the extraction of general purpose mandatory fields.
Example
Say you have some source dictionary meta that you've fetched as JSON with HTTP request and it has a key summary:
meta = self._download_json(url, video_id)
Assume at this point meta's layout is:
{
    ...
    ""summary"": ""some fancy summary text"",
    ...
}
Assume you want to extract summary and put it into the resulting info dict as description. Since description is an optional meta field you should be ready that this key may be missing from the meta dict, so that you should extract it like:
description = meta.get('summary')  # correct
and not like:
description = meta['summary']  # incorrect
The latter will break extraction process with KeyError if summary disappears from meta at some later time but with the former approach extraction will just go ahead with description set to None which is perfectly fine (remember None is equivalent to the absence of data).
Similarly, you should pass fatal=False when extracting optional data from a webpage with _search_regex, _html_search_regex or similar methods, for instance:
description = self._search_regex(
    r'<span[^>]+id=""title""[^>]*>([^<]+)<',
    webpage, 'description', fatal=False)
With fatal set to False if _search_regex fails to extract description it will emit a warning and continue extraction.
You can also pass default=<some fallback value>, for example:
description = self._search_regex(
    r'<span[^>]+id=""title""[^>]*>([^<]+)<',
    webpage, 'description', default=None)
On failure this code will silently continue the extraction with description set to None. That is useful for metafields that may or may not be present.
Provide fallbacks
When extracting metadata try to do so from multiple sources. For example if title is present in several places, try extracting from at least some of them. This makes it more future-proof in case some of the sources become unavailable.
Example
Say meta from the previous example has a title and you are about to extract it. Since title is a mandatory meta field you should end up with something like:
title = meta['title']
If title disappears from meta in future due to some changes on the hoster's side the extraction would fail since title is mandatory. That's expected.
Assume that you have some another source you can extract title from, for example og:title HTML meta of a webpage. In this case you can provide a fallback scenario:
title = meta.get('title') or self._og_search_title(webpage)
This code will try to extract from meta first and if it fails it will try extracting og:title from a webpage.
Regular expressions
Don't capture groups you don't use
Capturing group must be an indication that it's used somewhere in the code. Any group that is not used must be non capturing.
Example
Don't capture id attribute name here since you can't use it for anything anyway.
Correct:
r'(?:id|ID)=(?P<id>\d+)'
Incorrect:
r'(id|ID)=(?P<id>\d+)'
Make regular expressions relaxed and flexible
When using regular expressions try to write them fuzzy, relaxed and flexible, skipping insignificant parts that are more likely to change, allowing both single and double quotes for quoted values and so on.
Example
Say you need to extract title from the following HTML code:
<span style=""position: absolute; left: 910px; width: 90px; float: right; z-index: 9999;"" class=""title"">some fancy title</span>
The code for that task should look similar to:
title = self._search_regex(
    r'<span[^>]+class=""title""[^>]*>([^<]+)', webpage, 'title')
Or even better:
title = self._search_regex(
    r'<span[^>]+class=([""\'])title\1[^>]*>(?P<title>[^<]+)',
    webpage, 'title', group='title')
Note how you tolerate potential changes in the style attribute's value or switch from using double quotes to single for class attribute:
The code definitely should not look like:
title = self._search_regex(
    r'<span style=""position: absolute; left: 910px; width: 90px; float: right; z-index: 9999;"" class=""title"">(.*?)</span>',
    webpage, 'title', group='title')
Long lines policy
There is a soft limit to keep lines of code under 80 characters long. This means it should be respected if possible and if it does not make readability and code maintenance worse.
For example, you should never split long string literals like URLs or some other often copied entities over multiple lines to fit this limit:
Correct:
'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqZTN594JQw&list=PLMYEtVRpaqY00V9W81Cwmzp6N6vZqfUKD4'
Incorrect:
'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqZTN594JQw&list='
'PLMYEtVRpaqY00V9W81Cwmzp6N6vZqfUKD4'
Use convenience conversion and parsing functions
Wrap all extracted numeric data into safe functions from youtube_dl/utils.py: int_or_none, float_or_none. Use them for string to number conversions as well.
Use url_or_none for safe URL processing.
Use try_get for safe metadata extraction from parsed JSON.
Use unified_strdate for uniform upload_date or any YYYYMMDD meta field extraction, unified_timestamp for uniform timestamp extraction, parse_filesize for filesize extraction, parse_count for count meta fields extraction, parse_resolution, parse_duration for duration extraction, parse_age_limit for age_limit extraction.
Explore youtube_dl/utils.py for more useful convenience functions.
More examples
Safely extract optional description from parsed JSON
description = try_get(response, lambda x: x['result']['video'][0]['summary'], compat_str)
Safely extract more optional metadata
video = try_get(response, lambda x: x['result']['video'][0], dict) or {}
description = video.get('summary')
duration = float_or_none(video.get('durationMs'), scale=1000)
view_count = int_or_none(video.get('views'))
EMBEDDING YOUTUBE-DL
youtube-dl makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language. If you encounter any problems parsing its output, feel free to create a report.
From a Python program, you can embed youtube-dl in a more powerful fashion, like this:
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import youtube_dl

ydl_opts = {}
with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    ydl.download(['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'])
Most likely, you'll want to use various options. For a list of options available, have a look at youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py. For a start, if you want to intercept youtube-dl's output, set a logger object.
Here's a more complete example of a program that outputs only errors (and a short message after the download is finished), and downloads/converts the video to an mp3 file:
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import youtube_dl


class MyLogger(object):
    def debug(self, msg):
        pass

    def warning(self, msg):
        pass

    def error(self, msg):
        print(msg)


def my_hook(d):
    if d['status'] == 'finished':
        print('Done downloading, now converting ...')


ydl_opts = {
    'format': 'bestaudio/best',
    'postprocessors': [{
        'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
        'preferredcodec': 'mp3',
        'preferredquality': '192',
    }],
    'logger': MyLogger(),
    'progress_hooks': [my_hook],
}
with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    ydl.download(['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'])
BUGS
Bugs and suggestions should be reported at: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues. Unless you were prompted to or there is another pertinent reason (e.g. GitHub fails to accept the bug report), please do not send bug reports via personal email. For discussions, join us in the IRC channel #youtube-dl on freenode (webchat).
Please include the full output of youtube-dl when run with -v, i.e. add -v flag to your command line, copy the whole output and post it in the issue body wrapped in ``` for better formatting. It should look similar to this:
$ youtube-dl -v <your command line>

Do not post screenshots of verbose logs; only plain text is acceptable.
The output (including the first lines) contains important debugging information. Issues without the full output are often not reproducible and therefore do not get solved in short order, if ever.
Please re-read your issue once again to avoid a couple of common mistakes (you can and should use this as a checklist):
Is the description of the issue itself sufficient?
We often get issue reports that we cannot really decipher. While in most cases we eventually get the required information after asking back multiple times, this poses an unnecessary drain on our resources. Many contributors, including myself, are also not native speakers, so we may misread some parts.
So please elaborate on what feature you are requesting, or what bug you want to be fixed. Make sure that it's obvious

What the problem is
How it could be fixed
How your proposed solution would look like

If your report is shorter than two lines, it is almost certainly missing some of these, which makes it hard for us to respond to it. We're often too polite to close the issue outright, but the missing info makes misinterpretation likely. As a committer myself, I often get frustrated by these issues, since the only possible way for me to move forward on them is to ask for clarification over and over.
For bug reports, this means that your report should contain the complete output of youtube-dl when called with the -v flag. The error message you get for (most) bugs even says so, but you would not believe how many of our bug reports do not contain this information.
If your server has multiple IPs or you suspect censorship, adding --call-home may be a good idea to get more diagnostics. If the error is ERROR: Unable to extract ... and you cannot reproduce it from multiple countries, add --dump-pages (warning: this will yield a rather large output, redirect it to the file log.txt by adding >log.txt 2>&1 to your command-line) or upload the .dump files you get when you add --write-pages somewhere.
Site support requests must contain an example URL. An example URL is a URL you might want to download, like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc. There should be an obvious video present. Except under very special circumstances, the main page of a video service (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/) is not an example URL.
Are you using the latest version?
Before reporting any issue, type youtube-dl -U. This should report that you're up-to-date. About 20% of the reports we receive are already fixed, but people are using outdated versions. This goes for feature requests as well.
Is the issue already documented?
Make sure that someone has not already opened the issue you're trying to open. Search at the top of the window or browse the GitHub Issues of this repository. If there is an issue, feel free to write something along the lines of ""This affects me as well, with version 2015.01.01. Here is some more information on the issue: ..."". While some issues may be old, a new post into them often spurs rapid activity.
Why are existing options not enough?
Before requesting a new feature, please have a quick peek at the list of supported options. Many feature requests are for features that actually exist already! Please, absolutely do show off your work in the issue report and detail how the existing similar options do not solve your problem.
Is there enough context in your bug report?
People want to solve problems, and often think they do us a favor by breaking down their larger problems (e.g. wanting to skip already downloaded files) to a specific request (e.g. requesting us to look whether the file exists before downloading the info page). However, what often happens is that they break down the problem into two steps: One simple, and one impossible (or extremely complicated one).
We are then presented with a very complicated request when the original problem could be solved far easier, e.g. by recording the downloaded video IDs in a separate file. To avoid this, you must include the greater context where it is non-obvious. In particular, every feature request that does not consist of adding support for a new site should contain a use case scenario that explains in what situation the missing feature would be useful.
Does the issue involve one problem, and one problem only?
Some of our users seem to think there is a limit of issues they can or should open. There is no limit of issues they can or should open. While it may seem appealing to be able to dump all your issues into one ticket, that means that someone who solves one of your issues cannot mark the issue as closed. Typically, reporting a bunch of issues leads to the ticket lingering since nobody wants to attack that behemoth, until someone mercifully splits the issue into multiple ones.
In particular, every site support request issue should only pertain to services at one site (generally under a common domain, but always using the same backend technology). Do not request support for vimeo user videos, White house podcasts, and Google Plus pages in the same issue. Also, make sure that you don't post bug reports alongside feature requests. As a rule of thumb, a feature request does not include outputs of youtube-dl that are not immediately related to the feature at hand. Do not post reports of a network error alongside the request for a new video service.
Is anyone going to need the feature?
Only post features that you (or an incapacitated friend you can personally talk to) require. Do not post features because they seem like a good idea. If they are really useful, they will be requested by someone who requires them.
Is your question about youtube-dl?
It may sound strange, but some bug reports we receive are completely unrelated to youtube-dl and relate to a different, or even the reporter's own, application. Please make sure that you are actually using youtube-dl. If you are using a UI for youtube-dl, report the bug to the maintainer of the actual application providing the UI. On the other hand, if your UI for youtube-dl fails in some way you believe is related to youtube-dl, by all means, go ahead and report the bug.

Puppeteer
   

API | FAQ | Contributing | Troubleshooting

Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

What can I do?
Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. ""SSR"" (Server-Side Rendering)).
Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
Test Chrome Extensions.

Give it a spin: https://try-puppeteer.appspot.com/
Getting Started
Installation
To use Puppeteer in your project, run:
npm i puppeteer
# or ""yarn add puppeteer""
Note: When you install Puppeteer, it downloads a recent version of Chromium (~170MB Mac, ~282MB Linux, ~280MB Win) that is guaranteed to work with the API. To skip the download, see Environment variables.
puppeteer-core
Since version 1.7.0 we publish the puppeteer-core package,
a version of Puppeteer that doesn't download Chromium by default.
npm i puppeteer-core
# or ""yarn add puppeteer-core""
puppeteer-core is intended to be a lightweight version of Puppeteer for launching an existing browser installation or for connecting to a remote one. Be sure that the version of puppeteer-core you install is compatible with the
browser you intend to connect to.
See puppeteer vs puppeteer-core.
Usage
Note: Puppeteer requires at least Node v6.4.0, but the examples below use async/await which is only supported in Node v7.6.0 or greater.
Puppeteer will be familiar to people using other browser testing frameworks. You create an instance
of Browser, open pages, and then manipulate them with Puppeteer's API.
Example - navigating to https://example.com and saving a screenshot as example.png:
Save file as example.js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await page.screenshot({path: 'example.png'});

  await browser.close();
})();
Execute script on the command line
node example.js
Puppeteer sets an initial page size to 800px x 600px, which defines the screenshot size. The page size can be customized  with Page.setViewport().
Example - create a PDF.
Save file as hn.js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com', {waitUntil: 'networkidle2'});
  await page.pdf({path: 'hn.pdf', format: 'A4'});

  await browser.close();
})();
Execute script on the command line
node hn.js
See Page.pdf() for more information about creating pdfs.
Example - evaluate script in the context of the page
Save file as get-dimensions.js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');

  // Get the ""viewport"" of the page, as reported by the page.
  const dimensions = await page.evaluate(() => {
    return {
      width: document.documentElement.clientWidth,
      height: document.documentElement.clientHeight,
      deviceScaleFactor: window.devicePixelRatio
    };
  });

  console.log('Dimensions:', dimensions);

  await browser.close();
})();
Execute script on the command line
node get-dimensions.js
See Page.evaluate() for more information on evaluate and related methods like evaluateOnNewDocument and exposeFunction.
Default runtime settings
1. Uses Headless mode
Puppeteer launches Chromium in headless mode. To launch a full version of Chromium, set the 'headless' option when launching a browser:
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false}); // default is true
2. Runs a bundled version of Chromium
By default, Puppeteer downloads and uses a specific version of Chromium so its API
is guaranteed to work out of the box. To use Puppeteer with a different version of Chrome or Chromium,
pass in the executable's path when creating a Browser instance:
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({executablePath: '/path/to/Chrome'});
See Puppeteer.launch() for more information.
See this article for a description of the differences between Chromium and Chrome. This article describes some differences for Linux users.
3. Creates a fresh user profile
Puppeteer creates its own Chromium user profile which it cleans up on every run.

Debugging tips


Turn off headless mode - sometimes it's useful to see what the browser is
displaying. Instead of launching in headless mode, launch a full version of
the browser using  headless: false:
 const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false});



Slow it down - the slowMo option slows down Puppeteer operations by the
specified amount of milliseconds. It's another way to help see what's going on.
 const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
   headless: false,
   slowMo: 250 // slow down by 250ms
 });



Capture console output - You can listen for the console event.
This is also handy when debugging code in page.evaluate():
 page.on('console', msg => console.log('PAGE LOG:', msg.text()));

 await page.evaluate(() => console.log(`url is ${location.href}`));



Stop test execution and use a debugger in browser




Use {devtools: true} when launching Puppeteer:
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({devtools: true});


Change default test timeout:
jest: jest.setTimeout(100000);
jasmine: jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 100000;
mocha: this.timeout(100000); (don't forget to change test to use function and not '=>')


Add an evaluate statement with debugger inside / add  debugger to an existing evaluate statement:
await page.evaluate(() => {debugger;});
The test will now stop executing in the above evaluate statement, and chromium will stop in debug mode.




Enable verbose logging - internal DevTools protocol traffic
will be logged via the debug module under the puppeteer namespace.
 # Basic verbose logging
 env DEBUG=""puppeteer:*"" node script.js

 # Protocol traffic can be rather noisy. This example filters out all Network domain messages
 env DEBUG=""puppeteer:*"" env DEBUG_COLORS=true node script.js 2>&1 | grep -v '""Network'



Debug your Puppeteer (node) code easily, using ndb




npm install -g ndb (or even better, use npx!)


add a debugger to your Puppeteer (node) code


add ndb (or npx ndb) before your test command. For example:
ndb jest or ndb mocha (or npx ndb jest / npx ndb mocha)


debug your test inside chromium like a boss!

FAQ
Q: Who maintains Puppeteer?
The Chrome DevTools team maintains the library, but we'd love your help and expertise on the project!
See Contributing.
Q: What are Puppeteer’s goals and principles?
The goals of the project are:

Provide a slim, canonical library that highlights the capabilities of the DevTools Protocol.
Provide a reference implementation for similar testing libraries. Eventually, these other frameworks could adopt Puppeteer as their foundational layer.
Grow the adoption of headless/automated browser testing.
Help dogfood new DevTools Protocol features...and catch bugs!
Learn more about the pain points of automated browser testing and help fill those gaps.

We adapt Chromium principles to help us drive product decisions:

Speed: Puppeteer has almost zero performance overhead over an automated page.
Security: Puppeteer operates off-process with respect to Chromium, making it safe to automate potentially malicious pages.
Stability: Puppeteer should not be flaky and should not leak memory.
Simplicity: Puppeteer provides a high-level API that’s easy to use, understand, and debug.

Q: Is Puppeteer replacing Selenium/WebDriver?
No. Both projects are valuable for very different reasons:

Selenium/WebDriver focuses on cross-browser automation; its value proposition is a single standard API that works across all major browsers.
Puppeteer focuses on Chromium; its value proposition is richer functionality and higher reliability.

That said, you can use Puppeteer to run tests against Chromium, e.g. using the community-driven jest-puppeteer. While this probably shouldn’t be your only testing solution, it does have a few good points compared to WebDriver:

Puppeteer requires zero setup and comes bundled with the Chromium version it works best with, making it very easy to start with. At the end of the day, it’s better to have a few tests running chromium-only, than no tests at all.
Puppeteer has event-driven architecture, which removes a lot of potential flakiness. There’s no need for evil “sleep(1000)” calls in puppeteer scripts.
Puppeteer runs headless by default, which makes it fast to run. Puppeteer v1.5.0 also exposes browser contexts, making it possible to efficiently parallelize test execution.
Puppeteer shines when it comes to debugging: flip the “headless” bit to false, add “slowMo”, and you’ll see what the browser is doing. You can even open Chrome DevTools to inspect the test environment.

Q: Why doesn’t Puppeteer v.XXX work with Chromium v.YYY?
We see Puppeteer as an indivisible entity with Chromium. Each version of Puppeteer bundles a specific version of Chromium – the only version it is guaranteed to work with.
This is not an artificial constraint: A lot of work on Puppeteer is actually taking place in the Chromium repository. Here’s a typical story:

A Puppeteer bug is reported: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/2709
It turned out this is an issue with the DevTools protocol, so we’re fixing it in Chromium: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1102154
Once the upstream fix is landed, we roll updated Chromium into Puppeteer: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/pull/2769

However, oftentimes it is desirable to use Puppeteer with the official Google Chrome rather than Chromium. For this to work, you should install a puppeteer-core version that corresponds to the Chrome version.
For example, in order to drive Chrome 71 with puppeteer-core, use chrome-71 npm tag:
npm install puppeteer-core@chrome-71
Q: Which Chromium version does Puppeteer use?
Look for chromium_revision in package.json.
Q: What’s considered a “Navigation”?
From Puppeteer’s standpoint, “navigation” is anything that changes a page’s URL.
Aside from regular navigation where the browser hits the network to fetch a new document from the web server, this includes anchor navigations and History API usage.
With this definition of “navigation,” Puppeteer works seamlessly with single-page applications.
Q: What’s the difference between a “trusted"" and ""untrusted"" input event?
In browsers, input events could be divided into two big groups: trusted vs. untrusted.

Trusted events: events generated by users interacting with the page, e.g. using a mouse or keyboard.
Untrusted event: events generated by Web APIs, e.g. document.createEvent or element.click() methods.

Websites can distinguish between these two groups:

using an Event.isTrusted event flag
sniffing for accompanying events. For example, every trusted 'click' event is preceded by 'mousedown' and 'mouseup' events.

For automation purposes it’s important to generate trusted events. All input events generated with Puppeteer are trusted and fire proper accompanying events. If, for some reason, one needs an untrusted event, it’s always possible to hop into a page context with page.evaluate and generate a fake event:
await page.evaluate(() => {
  document.querySelector('button[type=submit]').click();
});
Q: What features does Puppeteer not support?
You may find that Puppeteer does not behave as expected when controlling pages that incorporate audio and video. (For example, video playback/screenshots is likely to fail.) There are two reasons for this:

Puppeteer is bundled with Chromium--not Chrome--and so by default, it inherits all of Chromium's media-related limitations. This means that Puppeteer does not support licensed formats such as AAC or H.264. (However, it is possible to force Puppeteer to use a separately-installed version Chrome instead of Chromium via the executablePath option to puppeteer.launch. You should only use this configuration if you need an official release of Chrome that supports these media formats.)
Since Puppeteer (in all configurations) controls a desktop version of Chromium/Chrome, features that are only supported by the mobile version of Chrome are not supported. This means that Puppeteer does not support HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).

Q: I am having trouble installing / running Puppeteer in my test environment?
We have a troubleshooting guide for various operating systems that lists the required dependencies.
Q: How do I try/test a prerelease version of Puppeteer?
You can check out this repo or install the latest prerelease from npm:
npm i --save puppeteer@next
Please note that prerelease may be unstable and contain bugs.
Q: I have more questions! Where do I ask?

Introduction
webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,
or packaging just about any resource or asset.
TL;DR

Bundles ES Modules, CommonJS, and AMD modules (even combined).
Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

Get Started
Check out webpack's quick Get Started guide and the other guides.
Browser Compatibility
webpack supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported).
webpack also needs Promise for import() and require.ensure(). If you want to support older browsers, you will need to load a polyfill before using these expressions.
Concepts
Plugins
webpack has a rich plugin
interface. Most of the features
within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very
flexible.

Loaders
webpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle
any static resource way beyond JavaScript. You can easily write your own
loaders using Node.js.
Loaders are activated by using loadername! prefixes in require() statements,
or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.

Performance
webpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast
and incredibly fast on incremental compilations.
Module Formats
webpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules out of the box. It performs clever static
analysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate
simple expressions. This allows you to support most existing libraries out of the box.
Code Splitting
webpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are
loaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.
Optimizations
webpack can do many optimizations to reduce the output size of your
JavaScript by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving
you full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime
through code splitting. It can also make your code chunks cache
friendly by using hashes.
Contributing
We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone. We have a vibrant ecosystem that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in our organization or webpack-contrib organization which houses all of our loaders and plugins.
Contributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:

Documentation updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes
Spelling or grammar fixes
README.md corrections or redesigns
Adding unit, or functional tests
Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.
Searching #webpack on twitter and helping someone else who needs help
Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!
Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials about one of webpack's many features.
Helping others in our webpack gitter channel.

If you are worried or don't know where to start, you can always reach out to Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!
We have also started a series on our Medium Publication called The Contributor's Guide to webpack. We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.
Looking to speak about webpack? We'd love to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!
Creating your own plugins and loaders
If you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the x-loader, x-webpack-plugin naming convention.
Support
We consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of its flexibility, webpack isn't always the easiest entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!
If you're just getting started, take a look at our new docs and concepts page. This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!
Looking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old wiki, but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.
If you want to discuss something or just need help, here is our Gitter room where there are always individuals looking to help out!
If you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post
a question to StackOverflow with the webpack tag. It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)
If you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.

Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

A Integer Partition
A Maximum Subarray
A Bellman-Ford Algorithm - finding shortest path to all graph vertices
A Floyd-Warshall Algorithm - find shortest paths between all pairs of vertices
A Regular Expression Matching


Backtracking - similarly to brute force, try to generate all possible solutions, but each time you generate next solution you test
if it satisfies all conditions, and only then continue generating subsequent solutions. Otherwise, backtrack, and go on a
different path of finding a solution. Normally the DFS traversal of state-space is being used.

B Jump Game
B Unique Paths
B Power Set - all subsets of a set
A Hamiltonian Cycle - Visit every vertex exactly once
A N-Queens Problem
A Knight's Tour
A Combination Sum - find all combinations that form specific sum


Branch & Bound - remember the lowest-cost solution found at each stage of the backtracking
search, and use the cost of the lowest-cost solution found so far as a lower bound on the cost of
a least-cost solution to the problem, in order to discard partial solutions with costs larger than the
lowest-cost solution found so far. Normally BFS traversal in combination with DFS traversal of state-space
tree is being used.

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(Not to be confused with a WordPress framework – Redux Framework.)
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

Note: We are currently planning a rewrite of the Redux docs. Please take some time to fill out this survey on what content is most important in a docs site. Thanks!






Learn Redux
We have a variety of resources available to help you learn Redux, no matter what your background or learning style is.
Just the Basics
If you're brand new to Redux and want to understand the basic concepts, see:

The Motivation behind building Redux, the Core Concepts, and the Three Principles.
The basic tutorial in the Redux docs
Redux creator Dan Abramov's free ""Getting Started with Redux"" video series on Egghead.io
Redux co-maintainer Mark Erikson's ""Redux Fundamentals"" slideshow and list of suggested resources for learning Redux
If you learn best by looking at code and playing with it, check out our list of Redux example applications, available as separate projects in the Redux repo, and also as interactive online examples on CodeSandbox.
The Redux Tutorials section of the React/Redux links list. Here's a top list of our recommended tutorials:

Dave Ceddia's posts What Does Redux Do? (and when should you use it?) and How Redux Works: A Counter-Example are a great intro to the basics of Redux and how to use it with React, as is this post on React and Redux: An Introduction.
Valentino Gagliardi's post React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: Learning Redux in 2018 is an excellent extended introduction to many aspects of using Redux.
The CSS Tricks article Leveling Up with React: Redux covers the Redux basics well.
This DevGuides: Introduction to Redux tutorial covers several aspects of Redux, including actions, reducers, usage with React, and middleware.



Intermediate Concepts
Once you've picked up the basics of working with actions, reducers, and the store, you may have questions about topics like working with asynchronous logic and AJAX requests, connecting a UI framework like React to your Redux store, and setting up an application to use Redux:

The ""Advanced"" docs section covers working with async logic, middleware, routing.
The Redux docs ""Learning Resources"" page points to recommended articles on a variety of Redux-related topics.
Sophie DeBenedetto's 8-part Building a Simple CRUD App with React + Redux series shows how to put together a basic CRUD app from scratch.

Real-World Usage
Going from a TodoMVC app to a real production application can be a big jump, but we've got plenty of resources to help:

Redux creator Dan Abramov's free ""Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux"" video series builds on his first video series and covers topics like middleware, routing, and persistence.
The Redux FAQ answers many common questions about how to use Redux, and the ""Recipes"" docs section has information on handling derived data, testing, structuring reducer logic, and reducing boilerplate.
Redux co-maintainer Mark Erikson's ""Practical Redux"" tutorial series demonstrates real-world intermediate and advanced techniques for working with React and Redux (also available as an interactive course on Educative.io).
The React/Redux links list has categorized articles on working with reducers and selectors, managing side effects, Redux architecture and best practices, and more.
Our community has created thousands of Redux-related libraries, addons, and tools. The ""Ecosystem"" docs page lists our recommendations, and there's a complete listing available in the Redux addons catalog.
If you're looking to learn from actual application codebases, the addons catalog also has a list of purpose-built examples and real-world applications.

Finally, Mark Erikson is teaching a series of Redux workshops through Workshop.me. Check the workshop schedule for upcoming dates and locations.
Help and Discussion
The #redux channel of the Reactiflux Discord community is our official resource for all questions related to learning and using Redux. Reactiflux is a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn - come join us!
Before Proceeding Further
Redux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. Don't use Redux just because someone said you should - take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.
Here are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:

You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time
You need a single source of truth for your state
You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient

Yes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.

Redux FAQ


Developer Experience
Dan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called “Hot Reloading with Time Travel”. His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
Influences
Redux evolves the ideas of Flux, but avoids its complexity by taking cues from Elm.
Even if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.
Installation
To install the stable version:
npm install --save redux
This assumes you are using npm as your package manager.
If you're not, you can access these files on unpkg, download them, or point your package manager to them.
Most commonly, people consume Redux as a collection of CommonJS modules. These modules are what you get when you import redux in a Webpack, Browserify, or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use Rollup, we support that as well.
If you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The redux npm package includes precompiled production and development UMD builds in the dist folder. They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a <script> tag on the page, or tell Bower to install it. The UMD builds make Redux available as a window.Redux global variable.
The Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in any modern browser. You don't need to use Babel or a module bundler to get started with Redux. You can even use the ES module build that's available at es/redux.mjs which can be referenced using type=""module"" in your script tag or as a standard import.
Complementary Packages
Most likely, you'll also need the React bindings and the developer tools.
npm install --save react-redux
npm install --save-dev redux-devtools
Note that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don't provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like Webpack and Browserify for the most comfortable development experience.
The Gist
The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.
The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.
That's it!
import { createStore } from 'redux'

/**
 * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.
 * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.
 *
 * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,
 * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should
 * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
 *
 * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that
 * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your
 * project.
 */
function counter(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1
    default:
      return state
  }
}

// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.
// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.
let store = createStore(counter)

// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.
// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.
// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))

// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.
// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
// 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
// 2
store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })
// 1
Instead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called actions. Then you write a special function called a reducer to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.
If you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.
This architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.

Welcome to Swift
Swift is a high-performance system programming language.  It has a clean
and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code
and frameworks, and is memory safe by default.
Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a
C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core
features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level
constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces
modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.
To learn more about the programming language, visit swift.org.
Contributing to Swift
Contributions to Swift are welcomed and encouraged! Please see the
Contributing to Swift guide.
To be a truly great community, Swift.org needs to welcome
developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide
range of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great
ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work
diligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.
To give clarity of what is expected of our members, Swift has adopted the
code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant. This document is used
across many open source communities, and we think it articulates our values
well. For more, see the Code of Conduct.
Getting Started
These instructions give the most direct path to a working Swift development
environment. To build from source you will need about 2 GB of disk space for the
source code and up to 70 GB of disk space for the build artifacts with full
debugging. Depending on your machine, a clean build can take a few minutes to
several hours. Naturally, incremental builds are much faster.
System Requirements
macOS, Ubuntu Linux LTS, and the latest Ubuntu Linux release are the current
supported host development operating systems.
Please make sure you use Python 2.x. Python 3.x is not supported currently.
macOS
To build for macOS, you need Xcode 10.2 beta.
The required version of Xcode changes frequently, and is often a beta release.
Check this document or the host information on https://ci.swift.org for the
current required version.
You will also need CMake and Ninja,
which can be installed via a package manager:
Homebrew
brew install cmake ninja

MacPorts
sudo port install cmake ninja

Instructions for installing CMake and Ninja directly can be found below.
Linux
For Ubuntu, you'll need the following development dependencies:
sudo apt-get install git cmake ninja-build clang python uuid-dev libicu-dev icu-devtools libbsd-dev libedit-dev libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev swig libpython-dev libncurses5-dev pkg-config libblocksruntime-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev systemtap-sdt-dev tzdata rsync

Note: LLDB currently requires at least swig-1.3.40 but will successfully build
with version 2 shipped with Ubuntu.
Build instructions for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS can be found here.
Getting Sources for Swift and Related Projects
First create a directory for all of the Swift sources:
mkdir swift-source
cd swift-source

Note: This is important since update-checkout (see below) checks out
repositories next to the Swift source directory. This means that if one clones
Swift and has other unrelated repositories, update-checkout may not clone those
repositories and will update them instead.
Via HTTPS  For those checking out sources as read-only, HTTPS works best:
git clone https://github.com/apple/swift.git
./swift/utils/update-checkout --clone

Via SSH  For those who plan on regularly making direct commits,
cloning over SSH may provide a better experience (which requires
uploading SSH keys to GitHub):
git clone git@github.com:apple/swift.git
./swift/utils/update-checkout --clone-with-ssh

Building Swift
The build-script is a high-level build automation script that supports basic
options such as building a Swift-compatible LLDB, building the Swift Package
Manager, building for various platforms, running tests after builds, and more.
There are two primary build systems to use: Xcode and Ninja. The Xcode build
system allows you to work in Xcode, but Ninja is a bit faster and supports
more environments.
To build using Ninja, run:
utils/build-script --release-debuginfo

When developing Swift, it helps to build what you're working on in a debug
configuration while building the rest of the project with optimizations. Below
are some examples of using debug variants:
utils/build-script --release-debuginfo --debug-swift # Swift frontend built in debug
utils/build-script --release-debuginfo --debug-swift-stdlib # Standard library built in debug
utils/build-script --release-debuginfo --debug-swift --force-optimized-typechecker # Swift frontend sans type checker built in debug

Limiting the amount of debug code in the compiler has a very large impact on
Swift compile times, and in turn the test execution time. If you want to build
the entire project in debug, you can run:
utils/build-script --debug

For documentation of all available arguments, as well as additional usage
information, see the inline help:
utils/build-script -h

Xcode
To build using Xcode, specify the --xcode argument on any of the above commands.
Xcode can be used to edit the Swift source code, but it is not currently
fully supported as a build environment for SDKs other than macOS. The generated
Xcode project does not integrate with the test runner, but the tests can be run
with the 'check-swift' target.
Build Products
All of the build products are placed in swift-source/build/${TOOL}-${MODE}/${PRODUCT}-${PLATFORM}/.
If macOS Swift with Ninja in DebugAssert mode was built, all of the products
would be in swift-source/build/Ninja-DebugAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64/. It
helps to save this directory as an environment variable for future use.
export SWIFT_BUILD_DIR=""~/swift-source/build/Ninja-DebugAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64""

Ninja
Once the first build has completed, Ninja can perform fast incremental builds of
various products. These incremental builds are a big timesaver when developing
and debugging.
cd ${SWIFT_BUILD_DIR}
ninja swift

This will build the Swift compiler, but will not rebuild the standard library or
any other target. Building the swift-stdlib target as an additional layer of
testing from time to time is also a good idea. To build just the standard
library, run:
ninja swift-stdlib

It is always a good idea to do a full build after using update-checkout.
Using Xcode
To open the Swift project in Xcode, open ${SWIFT_BUILD_DIR}/Swift.xcodeproj.
It will auto-create a lot of schemes for all of the available targets. A
common debug flow would involve:

Select the 'swift' scheme.
Pull up the scheme editor (⌘⇧<).
Select the 'Arguments' tab and click the '+'.
Add the command line options.
Close the scheme editor.
Build and run.

Another option is to change the scheme to ""Wait for executable to be launched"",
then run the build product in Terminal.
Swift Toolchains
Building
Swift toolchains are created using the script
build-toolchain. This
script is used by swift.org's CI to produce snapshots and can allow for one to
locally reproduce such builds for development or distribution purposes. E.x.:
  $ ./utils/build-toolchain $BUNDLE_PREFIX

where $BUNDLE_PREFIX is a string that will be prepended to the build
date to give the bundle identifier of the toolchain's Info.plist. For
instance, if $BUNDLE_PREFIX was com.example, the toolchain
produced will have the bundle identifier com.example.YYYYMMDD. It
will be created in the directory you run the script with a filename
of the form: swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx.tar.gz.
Beyond building the toolchain, build-toolchain also supports the
following (non-exhaustive) set of useful options::

--dry-run: Perform a dry run build. This is off by default.
--test: Test the toolchain after it has been compiled. This is off by default.
--distcc: Use distcc to speed up the build by distributing the c++ part of
the swift build. This is off by default.

More options may be added over time. Please pass --help to
build-toolchain to see the full set of options.
Installing into Xcode
On macOS if one wants to install such a toolchain into Xcode:

Untar and copy the toolchain to one of /Library/Developer/Toolchains/ or
~/Library/Developer/Toolchains/. E.x.:

  $ sudo tar -xzf swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx.tar.gz -C /
  $ tar -xzf swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx.tar.gz -C ~/

The script also generates an archive containing debug symbols which
can be installed over the main archive allowing symbolication of any
compiler crashes.
  $ sudo tar -xzf swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx-symbols.tar.gz -C /
  $ tar -xzf swift-LOCAL-YYYY-MM-DD-a-osx-symbols.tar.gz -C ~/


Specify the local toolchain for Xcode's use via Xcode->Toolchains.

Build Failures
Make sure you are using the correct release of Xcode.
If you have changed Xcode versions but still encounter errors that appear to
be related to the Xcode version, try passing --clean to build-script.
When a new version of Xcode is released, you can update your build without
recompiling the entire project by passing the --reconfigure option.
Make sure all repositories are up to date with the update-checkout command
described above.
Testing Swift
See docs/Testing.md, in particular the section on lit.py.
Learning More
Be sure to look through the docs
directory for more information about the compiler. In particular, the documents
titled Debugging the Swift Compiler and
Continuous Integration for Swift are very
helpful to understand before submitting your first PR.
Building Documentation
To read the compiler documentation, start by installing the
Sphinx documentation generator tool by running the
command:
easy_install -U ""Sphinx < 2.0""

Once complete, you can build the Swift documentation by changing directory into
docs and typing make. This
compiles the .rst files in the docs
directory into HTML in the docs/_build/html directory.
Many of the docs are out of date, but you can see some historical design
documents in the docs directory.
Another source of documentation is the standard library itself, located in
stdlib. Much of the language is actually implemented in the library
(including Int), and the standard library gives some examples of what can be
expressed today.
Build Dependencies
CMake
CMake is the core infrastructure used to configure builds of
Swift and its companion projects; at least version 3.4.3 is required.
On macOS, you can download the CMake Binary Distribution,
bundled as an application, copy it to /Applications, and add the embedded
command line tools to your PATH:
export PATH=/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin:$PATH

On Linux, if you have not already installed Swift's development
dependencies, you can download and install the CMake
package separately using the following command:
sudo apt-get install cmake

Ninja
Ninja is the current recommended build system
for building Swift and is the default configuration generated by CMake. Pre-built
packages
are available for macOS and Linux distributions. You can also clone Ninja
next to the other projects and it will be bootstrapped automatically:
Via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja.git && cd ninja
git checkout release
cat README

Via SSH
git clone git@github.com:ninja-build/ninja.git && cd ninja
git checkout release
cat README

Design patterns implemented in Java




Introduction
Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system.
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.
Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues which cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.
Getting started
Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
Programming/Software Design Principles.
All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI,
and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and
patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
extensibility.
Once you are familiar with these concepts you can start drilling down into
patterns by any of the following approaches

Using difficulty tags, Difficulty-Beginner, Difficulty-Intermediate & Difficulty-Expert.
Using pattern categories, Creational, Behavioral and others.
Search for a specific pattern. Can't find one? Please report a new pattern here.

socket.io
 






Features
Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It consists of:

a Node.js server (this repository)
a Javascript client library for the browser (or a Node.js client)

Some implementations in other languages are also available:

Java
C++
Swift
Dart

Its main features are:
Reliability
Connections are established even in the presence of:

proxies and load balancers.
personal firewall and antivirus software.

For this purpose, it relies on Engine.IO, which first establishes a long-polling connection, then tries to upgrade to better transports that are ""tested"" on the side, like WebSocket. Please see the Goals section for more information.
Auto-reconnection support
Unless instructed otherwise a disconnected client will try to reconnect forever, until the server is available again. Please see the available reconnection options here.
Disconnection detection
A heartbeat mechanism is implemented at the Engine.IO level, allowing both the server and the client to know when the other one is not responding anymore.
That functionality is achieved with timers set on both the server and the client, with timeout values (the pingInterval and pingTimeout parameters) shared during the connection handshake. Those timers require any subsequent client calls to be directed to the same server, hence the sticky-session requirement when using multiples nodes.
Binary support
Any serializable data structures can be emitted, including:

ArrayBuffer and Blob in the browser
ArrayBuffer and Buffer in Node.js

Simple and convenient API
Sample code:
io.on('connection', socket => {
  socket.emit('request', /* … */); // emit an event to the socket
  io.emit('broadcast', /* … */); // emit an event to all connected sockets
  socket.on('reply', () => { /* … */ }); // listen to the event
});
Cross-browser
Browser support is tested in Saucelabs:

Multiplexing support
In order to create separation of concerns within your application (for example per module, or based on permissions), Socket.IO allows you to create several Namespaces, which will act as separate communication channels but will share the same underlying connection.
Room support
Within each Namespace, you can define arbitrary channels, called Rooms, that sockets can join and leave. You can then broadcast to any given room, reaching every socket that has joined it.
This is a useful feature to send notifications to a group of users, or to a given user connected on several devices for example.
Note: Socket.IO is not a WebSocket implementation. Although Socket.IO indeed uses WebSocket as a transport when possible, it adds some metadata to each packet: the packet type, the namespace and the ack id when a message acknowledgement is needed. That is why a WebSocket client will not be able to successfully connect to a Socket.IO server, and a Socket.IO client will not be able to connect to a WebSocket server (like ws://echo.websocket.org) either. Please see the protocol specification here.
Installation
npm install socket.io
How to use
The following example attaches socket.io to a plain Node.JS
HTTP server listening on port 3000.
const server = require('http').createServer();
const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', client => {
  client.on('event', data => { /* … */ });
  client.on('disconnect', () => { /* … */ });
});
server.listen(3000);
Standalone
const io = require('socket.io')();
io.on('connection', client => { ... });
io.listen(3000);
In conjunction with Express
Starting with 3.0, express applications have become request handler
functions that you pass to http or http Server instances. You need
to pass the Server to socket.io, and not the express application
function. Also make sure to call .listen on the server, not the app.
const app = require('express')();
const server = require('http').createServer(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', () => { /* … */ });
server.listen(3000);
In conjunction with Koa
Like Express.JS, Koa works by exposing an application as a request
handler function, but only by calling the callback method.
const app = require('koa')();
const server = require('http').createServer(app.callback());
const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', () => { /* … */ });
server.listen(3000);
Documentation
Please see the documentation here. Contributions are welcome!
Debug / logging
Socket.IO is powered by debug.
In order to see all the debug output, run your app with the environment variable
DEBUG including the desired scope.
To see the output from all of Socket.IO's debugging scopes you can use:
DEBUG=socket.io* node myapp

Testing
npm test

This runs the gulp task test. By default the test will be run with the source code in lib directory.
Set the environmental variable TEST_VERSION to compat to test the transpiled es5-compat version of the code.
The gulp task test will always transpile the source code into es5 and export to dist first before running the test.

Changelog: Up-to-date version history.
Examples: Presentations created with reveal.js, add your own!
Browser Support: Explanation of browser support and fallbacks.
Plugins: A list of plugins that can be used to extend reveal.js.

Online Editor
Presentations are written using HTML or Markdown but there's also an online editor for those of you who prefer a graphical interface. Give it a try at https://slides.com.
Installation
The basic setup is for authoring presentations only. The full setup gives you access to all reveal.js features and plugins such as speaker notes as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source.
Basic setup
The core of reveal.js is very easy to install. You'll simply need to download a copy of this repository and open the index.html file directly in your browser.

Download the latest version of reveal.js from https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases
Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own
Open index.html in a browser to view it

Full setup
Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code.


Install Node.js (4.0.0 or later)


Clone the reveal.js repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git


Navigate to the reveal.js folder
$ cd reveal.js


Install dependencies
$ npm install


Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
$ npm start


Open http://localhost:8000 to view your presentation
You can change the port by using npm start -- --port=8001.


Folder Structure

css/ Core styles without which the project does not function
js/ Like above but for JavaScript
plugin/ Components that have been developed as extensions to reveal.js
lib/ All other third party assets (JavaScript, CSS, fonts)

Instructions
Markup
Here's a barebones example of a fully working reveal.js presentation:
<html>
	<head>
		<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/reveal.css"">
		<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/theme/white.css"">
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class=""reveal"">
			<div class=""slides"">
				<section>Slide 1</section>
				<section>Slide 2</section>
			</div>
		</div>
		<script src=""js/reveal.js""></script>
		<script>
			Reveal.initialize();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
The presentation markup hierarchy needs to be .reveal > .slides > section where the section represents one slide and can be repeated indefinitely. If you place multiple section elements inside of another section they will be shown as vertical slides. The first of the vertical slides is the ""root"" of the others (at the top), and will be included in the horizontal sequence. For example:
<div class=""reveal"">
	<div class=""slides"">
		<section>Single Horizontal Slide</section>
		<section>
			<section>Vertical Slide 1</section>
			<section>Vertical Slide 2</section>
		</section>
	</div>
</div>
Markdown
It's possible to write your slides using Markdown. To enable Markdown, add the data-markdown attribute to your <section> elements and wrap the contents in a <textarea data-template> like the example below. You'll also need to add the plugin/markdown/marked.js and plugin/markdown/markdown.js scripts (in that order) to your HTML file.
This is based on data-markdown from Paul Irish modified to use marked to support GitHub Flavored Markdown. Sensitive to indentation (avoid mixing tabs and spaces) and line breaks (avoid consecutive breaks).
<section data-markdown>
	<textarea data-template>
		## Page title

		A paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se).
	</textarea>
</section>
External Markdown
You can write your content as a separate file and have reveal.js load it at runtime. Note the separator arguments which determine how slides are delimited in the external file: the data-separator attribute defines a regular expression for horizontal slides (defaults to ^\r?\n---\r?\n$, a newline-bounded horizontal rule)  and data-separator-vertical defines vertical slides (disabled by default). The data-separator-notes attribute is a regular expression for specifying the beginning of the current slide's speaker notes (defaults to notes?:, so it will match both ""note:"" and ""notes:""). The data-charset attribute is optional and specifies which charset to use when loading the external file.
When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js runs from a local web server.  The following example customises all available options:
<section data-markdown=""example.md""
         data-separator=""^\n\n\n""
         data-separator-vertical=""^\n\n""
         data-separator-notes=""^Note:""
         data-charset=""iso-8859-15"">
    <!--
        Note that Windows uses `\r\n` instead of `\n` as its linefeed character.
        For a regex that supports all operating systems, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n`.
    -->
</section>
Element Attributes
Special syntax (through HTML comments) is available for adding attributes to Markdown elements. This is useful for fragments, amongst other things.
<section data-markdown>
	<script type=""text/template"">
		- Item 1 <!-- .element: class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""2"" -->
		- Item 2 <!-- .element: class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""1"" -->
	</script>
</section>
Slide Attributes
Special syntax (through HTML comments) is available for adding attributes to the slide <section> elements generated by your Markdown.
<section data-markdown>
	<script type=""text/template"">
	<!-- .slide: data-background=""#ff0000"" -->
		Markdown content
	</script>
</section>
Configuring marked
We use marked to parse Markdown. To customise marked's rendering, you can pass in options when configuring Reveal:
Reveal.initialize({
	// Options which are passed into marked
	// See https://marked.js.org/#/USING_ADVANCED.md#options
	markdown: {
		smartypants: true
	}
});

	autoSlide: 0,

	// Stop auto-sliding after user input
	autoSlideStoppable: true,

	// Use this method for navigation when auto-sliding
	autoSlideMethod: Reveal.navigateNext,

	// Specify the average time in seconds that you think you will spend

	// Parallax background size
	parallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. ""2100px 900px""

	// Number of pixels to move the parallax background per slide
	// - Calculated automatically unless specified
	// - Set to 0 to disable movement along an axis
	parallaxBackgroundHorizontal: null,
	parallaxBackgroundVertical: null,

	// The display mode that will be used to show slides
	display: 'block'

});
The configuration can be updated after initialization using the configure method:
// Turn autoSlide off
Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 0 });

// Start auto-sliding every 5s
Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 5000 });
Presentation Size
All presentations have a normal size, that is, the resolution at which they are authored. The framework will automatically scale presentations uniformly based on this size to ensure that everything fits on any given display or viewport.
See below for a list of configuration options related to sizing, including default values:
Reveal.initialize({

	// ...

	// The ""normal"" size of the presentation, aspect ratio will be preserved
	// when the presentation is scaled to fit different resolutions. Can be
	// specified using percentage units.
	width: 960,
	height: 700,

	// Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content
	margin: 0.1,

	// Bounds for smallest/largest possible scale to apply to content
	minScale: 0.2,
	maxScale: 1.5

});
If you wish to disable this behavior and do your own scaling (e.g. using media queries), try these settings:
Reveal.initialize({

	// ...

	width: ""100%"",
	height: ""100%"",
	margin: 0,
	minScale: 1,
	maxScale: 1
});
Dependencies
Reveal.js doesn't rely on any third party scripts to work but a few optional libraries are included by default. These libraries are loaded as dependencies in the order they appear, for example:
Reveal.initialize({
	dependencies: [
		// Interpret Markdown in <section> elements
		{ src: 'plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },
		{ src: 'plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } },

		// Syntax highlight for <code> elements
		{ src: 'plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true },

		// Zoom in and out with Alt+click
		{ src: 'plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true },

		// Speaker notes
		{ src: 'plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true },

		// MathJax
		{ src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true }
	]
});
You can add your own extensions using the same syntax. The following properties are available for each dependency object:

src: Path to the script to load
async: [optional] Flags if the script should load after reveal.js has started, defaults to false
callback: [optional] Function to execute when the script has loaded
condition: [optional] Function which must return true for the script to be loaded

Ready Event
A ready event is fired when reveal.js has loaded all non-async dependencies and is ready to start navigating. To check if reveal.js is already 'ready' you can call Reveal.isReady().
Reveal.addEventListener( 'ready', function( event ) {
	// event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv
} );
Note that we also add a .ready class to the .reveal element so that you can hook into this with CSS.
Auto-sliding
Presentations can be configured to progress through slides automatically, without any user input. To enable this you will need to tell the framework how many milliseconds it should wait between slides:
// Slide every five seconds
Reveal.configure({
  autoSlide: 5000
});
When this is turned on a control element will appear that enables users to pause and resume auto-sliding. Alternatively, sliding can be paused or resumed by pressing »A« on the keyboard. Sliding is paused automatically as soon as the user starts navigating. You can disable these controls by specifying autoSlideStoppable: false in your reveal.js config.
You can also override the slide duration for individual slides and fragments by using the data-autoslide attribute:
<section data-autoslide=""2000"">
	<p>After 2 seconds the first fragment will be shown.</p>
	<p class=""fragment"" data-autoslide=""10000"">After 10 seconds the next fragment will be shown.</p>
	<p class=""fragment"">Now, the fragment is displayed for 2 seconds before the next slide is shown.</p>
</section>
To override the method used for navigation when auto-sliding, you can specify the autoSlideMethod setting. To only navigate along the top layer and ignore vertical slides, set this to Reveal.navigateRight.
Whenever the auto-slide mode is resumed or paused the autoslideresumed and autoslidepaused events are fired.
Keyboard Bindings
If you're unhappy with any of the default keyboard bindings you can override them using the keyboard config option:
Reveal.configure({
  keyboard: {
    13: 'next', // go to the next slide when the ENTER key is pressed
    27: function() {}, // do something custom when ESC is pressed
    32: null // don't do anything when SPACE is pressed (i.e. disable a reveal.js default binding)
  }
});
Vertical Slide Navigation
Slides can be nested within other slides to create vertical stacks (see Markup). When presenting, you use the left/right arrows to step through the main (horizontal) slides. When you arrive at a vertical stack you can optionally press the up/down arrows to view the vertical slides or skip past them by pressing the right arrow. Here's an example showing a bird's-eye view of what this looks like in action:

Navigation Mode
You can finetune the reveal.js navigation behavior by using the navigationMode config option. Note that these options are only useful for presnetations that use a mix of horizontal and vertical slides. The following navigation modes are available:



Value
Description




default
Left/right arrow keys step between horizontal slides. Up/down arrow keys step between vertical slides. Space key steps through all slides (both horizontal and vertical).


linear
Removes the up/down arrows. Left/right arrows step through all slides (both horizontal and vertical).


grid
When this is enabled, stepping left/right from a vertical stack to an adjacent vertical stack will land you at the same vertical index.Consider a deck with six slides ordered in two vertical stacks:1.1    2.11.2    2.21.3    2.3If you're on slide 1.3 and navigate right, you will normally move from 1.3 -> 2.1. With navigationMode set to ""grid"" the same navigation takes you from 1.3 -> 2.3.



Touch Navigation
You can swipe to navigate through a presentation on any touch-enabled device. Horizontal swipes change between horizontal slides, vertical swipes change between vertical slides. If you wish to disable this you can set the touch config option to false when initializing reveal.js.
If there's some part of your content that needs to remain accessible to touch events you'll need to highlight this by adding a data-prevent-swipe attribute to the element. One common example where this is useful is elements that need to be scrolled.
Lazy Loading
When working on presentation with a lot of media or iframe content it's important to load lazily. Lazy loading means that reveal.js will only load content for the few slides nearest to the current slide. The number of slides that are preloaded is determined by the viewDistance configuration option.
To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your src attributes to data-src as shown below. This is supported for image, video, audio and iframe elements.
<section>
  <img data-src=""image.png"">
  <iframe data-src=""http://hakim.se""></iframe>
  <video>
    <source data-src=""video.webm"" type=""video/webm"" />
    <source data-src=""video.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"" />
  </video>
</section>
Lazy Loading Iframes
Note that lazy loaded iframes ignore the viewDistance configuration and will only load when their containing slide becomes visible. Iframes are also unloaded as soon as the slide is hidden.
When we lazy load a video or audio element, reveal.js won't start playing that content until the slide becomes visible. However there is no way to control this for an iframe since that could contain any kind of content. That means if we loaded an iframe before the slide is visible on screen it could begin playing media and sound in the background.
You can override this behavior with the data-preload attribute. The iframe below will be loaded
according to the viewDistance.
<section>
	<iframe data-src=""http://hakim.se"" data-preload></iframe>
</section>
You can also change the default globally with the preloadIframes configuration option. If set to
true ALL iframes with a data-src attribute will be preloaded when within the viewDistance
regardless of individual data-preload attributes. If set to false, all iframes will only be
loaded when they become visible.
API
The Reveal object exposes a JavaScript API for controlling navigation and reading state:
// Navigation
Reveal.slide( indexh, indexv, indexf );
Reveal.left();
Reveal.right();
Reveal.up();
Reveal.down();
Reveal.prev();
Reveal.next();
Reveal.prevFragment();
Reveal.nextFragment();

// Randomize the order of slides
Reveal.shuffle();

// Toggle presentation states, optionally pass true/false to force on/off
Reveal.toggleOverview();
Reveal.togglePause();
Reveal.toggleAutoSlide();

// Shows a help overlay with keyboard shortcuts, optionally pass true/false
// to force on/off
Reveal.toggleHelp();

// Change a config value at runtime
Reveal.configure({ controls: true });

// Returns the present configuration options
Reveal.getConfig();

// Fetch the current scale of the presentation
Reveal.getScale();

// Retrieves the previous and current slide elements
Reveal.getPreviousSlide();
Reveal.getCurrentSlide();

Reveal.getIndices();        // { h: 0, v: 0, f: 0 }
Reveal.getSlidePastCount();
Reveal.getProgress();       // (0 == first slide, 1 == last slide)
Reveal.getSlides();         // Array of all slides
Reveal.getTotalSlides();    // Total number of slides

// Returns the speaker notes for the current slide
Reveal.getSlideNotes();

// State checks
Reveal.isFirstSlide();
Reveal.isLastSlide();
Reveal.isOverview();
Reveal.isPaused();
Reveal.isAutoSliding();

// Returns the top-level DOM element
getRevealElement(); // <div class=""reveal"">...</div>
Custom Key Bindings
Custom key bindings can be added and removed using the following Javascript API. Custom key bindings will override the default keyboard bindings, but will in turn be overridden by the user defined bindings in the keyboard config option.
Reveal.addKeyBinding( binding, callback );
Reveal.removeKeyBinding( keyCode );
For example
// The binding parameter provides the following properties
//      keyCode: the keycode for binding to the callback
//          key: the key label to show in the help overlay
//  description: the description of the action to show in the help overlay
Reveal.addKeyBinding( { keyCode: 84, key: 'T', description: 'Start timer' }, function() {
	// start timer
} )

// The binding parameter can also be a direct keycode without providing the help description
Reveal.addKeyBinding( 82, function() {
	// reset timer
} )
This allows plugins to add key bindings directly to Reveal so they can

make use of Reveal's pre-processing logic for key handling (for example, ignoring key presses when paused); and
be included in the help overlay (optional)

Slide Changed Event
A slidechanged event is fired each time the slide is changed (regardless of state). The event object holds the index values of the current slide as well as a reference to the previous and current slide HTML nodes.
Some libraries, like MathJax (see #226), get confused by the transforms and display states of slides. Often times, this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback.
Reveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) {
	// event.previousSlide, event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv
} );
Presentation State
The presentation's current state can be fetched by using the getState method. A state object contains all of the information required to put the presentation back as it was when getState was first called. Sort of like a snapshot. It's a simple object that can easily be stringified and persisted or sent over the wire.
Reveal.slide( 1 );
// we're on slide 1

var state = Reveal.getState();

Reveal.slide( 3 );
// we're on slide 3

Reveal.setState( state );
// we're back on slide 1
Slide States
If you set data-state=""somestate"" on a slide <section>, ""somestate"" will be applied as a class on the document element when that slide is opened. This allows you to apply broad style changes to the page based on the active slide.
Furthermore you can also listen to these changes in state via JavaScript:
Reveal.addEventListener( 'somestate', function() {
	// TODO: Sprinkle magic
}, false );
Slide Backgrounds
Slides are contained within a limited portion of the screen by default to allow them to fit any display and scale uniformly. You can apply full page backgrounds outside of the slide area by adding a data-background attribute to your <section> elements. Four different types of backgrounds are supported: color, image, video and iframe.
Color Backgrounds
All CSS color formats are supported, including hex values, keywords, rgba() or hsl().
<section data-background-color=""#ff0000"">
	<h2>Color</h2>
</section>
Image Backgrounds
By default, background images are resized to cover the full page. Available options:



Attribute
Default
Description




data-background-image

URL of the image to show. GIFs restart when the slide opens.


data-background-size
cover
See background-size on MDN.


data-background-position
center
See background-position on MDN.


data-background-repeat
no-repeat
See background-repeat on MDN.


data-background-opacity
1
Opacity of the background image on a 0-1 scale. 0 is transparent and 1 is fully opaque.



<section data-background-image=""http://example.com/image.png"">
	<h2>Image</h2>
</section>
<section data-background-image=""http://example.com/image.png"" data-background-size=""100px"" data-background-repeat=""repeat"">
	<h2>This background image will be sized to 100px and repeated</h2>
</section>
Video Backgrounds
Automatically plays a full size video behind the slide.



Attribute
Default
Description




data-background-video

A single video source, or a comma separated list of video sources.


data-background-video-loop
false
Flags if the video should play repeatedly.


data-background-video-muted
false
Flags if the audio should be muted.


data-background-size
cover
Use cover for full screen and some cropping or contain for letterboxing.


data-background-opacity
1
Opacity of the background video on a 0-1 scale. 0 is transparent and 1 is fully opaque.



<section data-background-video=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.mp4,https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.webm"" data-background-video-loop data-background-video-muted>
	<h2>Video</h2>
</section>
Iframe Backgrounds
Embeds a web page as a slide background that covers 100% of the reveal.js width and height. The iframe is in the background layer, behind your slides, and as such it's not possible to interact with it by default. To make your background interactive, you can add the data-background-interactive attribute.
<section data-background-iframe=""https://slides.com"" data-background-interactive>
	<h2>Iframe</h2>
</section>
Background Transitions
Backgrounds transition using a fade animation by default. This can be changed to a linear sliding transition by passing backgroundTransition: 'slide' to the Reveal.initialize() call. Alternatively you can set data-background-transition on any section with a background to override that specific transition.
Parallax Background
If you want to use a parallax scrolling background, set the first two properties below when initializing reveal.js (the other two are optional).
Reveal.initialize({

	// Parallax background image
	parallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. ""https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg""

	// Parallax background size
	parallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. ""2100px 900px"" - currently only pixels are supported (don't use % or auto)

	// Number of pixels to move the parallax background per slide
	// - Calculated automatically unless specified
	// - Set to 0 to disable movement along an axis
	parallaxBackgroundHorizontal: 200,
	parallaxBackgroundVertical: 50

});
Make sure that the background size is much bigger than screen size to allow for some scrolling. View example.
Slide Transitions
The global presentation transition is set using the transition config value. You can override the global transition for a specific slide by using the data-transition attribute:
<section data-transition=""zoom"">
	<h2>This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!</h2>
</section>

<section data-transition-speed=""fast"">
	<h2>Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!</h2>
</section>
You can also use different in and out transitions for the same slide:
<section data-transition=""slide"">
    The train goes on …
</section>
<section data-transition=""slide"">
    and on …
</section>
<section data-transition=""slide-in fade-out"">
    and stops.
</section>
<section data-transition=""fade-in slide-out"">
    (Passengers entering and leaving)
</section>
<section data-transition=""slide"">
    And it starts again.
</section>
You can choose from none, fade, slide, convex, concave and zoom.
Internal links
It's easy to link between slides. The first example below targets the index of another slide whereas the second targets a slide with an ID attribute (<section id=""some-slide"">):
<a href=""#/2/2"">Link</a>
<a href=""#/some-slide"">Link</a>
You can also add relative navigation links, similar to the built in reveal.js controls, by appending one of the following classes on any element. Note that each element is automatically given an enabled class when it's a valid navigation route based on the current slide.
<a href=""#"" class=""navigate-left"">
<a href=""#"" class=""navigate-right"">
<a href=""#"" class=""navigate-up"">
<a href=""#"" class=""navigate-down"">
<a href=""#"" class=""navigate-prev""> <!-- Previous vertical or horizontal slide -->
<a href=""#"" class=""navigate-next""> <!-- Next vertical or horizontal slide -->
Fragments
Fragments are used to highlight individual elements on a slide. Every element with the class fragment will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide. Here's an example: http://revealjs.com/#/fragments
The default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in. This style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment:
<section>
	<p class=""fragment grow"">grow</p>
	<p class=""fragment shrink"">shrink</p>
	<p class=""fragment fade-out"">fade-out</p>
	<p class=""fragment fade-up"">fade-up (also down, left and right!)</p>
	<p class=""fragment fade-in-then-out"">fades in, then out when we move to the next step</p>
	<p class=""fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"">fades in, then obfuscate when we move to the next step</p>
	<p class=""fragment highlight-current-blue"">blue only once</p>
	<p class=""fragment highlight-red"">highlight-red</p>
	<p class=""fragment highlight-green"">highlight-green</p>
	<p class=""fragment highlight-blue"">highlight-blue</p>
</section>
Multiple fragments can be applied to the same element sequentially by wrapping it, this will fade in the text on the first step and fade it back out on the second.
<section>
	<span class=""fragment fade-in"">
		<span class=""fragment fade-out"">I'll fade in, then out</span>
	</span>
</section>
The display order of fragments can be controlled using the data-fragment-index attribute.
<section>
	<p class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""3"">Appears last</p>
	<p class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""1"">Appears first</p>
	<p class=""fragment"" data-fragment-index=""2"">Appears second</p>
</section>
Fragment events
When a slide fragment is either shown or hidden reveal.js will dispatch an event.
Some libraries, like MathJax (see #505), get confused by the initially hidden fragment elements. Often times this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback.
Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmentshown', function( event ) {
	// event.fragment = the fragment DOM element
} );
Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmenthidden', function( event ) {
	// event.fragment = the fragment DOM element
} );
Code Syntax Highlighting
By default, Reveal is configured with highlight.js for code syntax highlighting. To enable syntax highlighting, you'll have to load the highlight plugin (plugin/highlight/highlight.js) and a highlight.js CSS theme (Reveal comes packaged with the Monokai themes: lib/css/monokai.css).
Reveal.initialize({
	// More info https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#dependencies
	dependencies: [
		{ src: 'plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true },
	]
});
Below is an example with clojure code that will be syntax highlighted. When the data-trim attribute is present, surrounding whitespace is automatically removed.  HTML will be escaped by default. To avoid this, for example if you are using <mark> to call out a line of code, add the data-noescape attribute to the <code> element.
<section>
	<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
(def lazy-fib
  (concat
   [0 1]
   <mark>((fn rfib [a b]</mark>
        (lazy-cons (+ a b) (rfib b (+ a b)))) 0 1)))
	</code></pre>
</section>
Line Numbers & Highlights
To enable line numbers, add data-line-numbers to your <code> tags. If you want to highlight specific lines you can provide a comma separated list of line numbers using the same attribute. For example, in the following example lines 4 and 8-11 are highlighted:
<pre><code class=""hljs"" data-line-numbers=""4,8-11"">
import React, { useState } from 'react';
 
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
</code></pre>

Slide number
If you would like to display the page number of the current slide you can do so using the slideNumber and showSlideNumber configuration values.
// Shows the slide number using default formatting
Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: true });

// Slide number formatting can be configured using these variables:
//  ""h.v"": 	horizontal . vertical slide number (default)
//  ""h/v"": 	horizontal / vertical slide number
//    ""c"": 	flattened slide number
//  ""c/t"": 	flattened slide number / total slides
Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: 'c/t' });

// You can provide a function to fully customize the number:
Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: function() {
    // Ignore numbering of vertical slides
    return [ Reveal.getIndices().h ];
}});

// Control which views the slide number displays on using the ""showSlideNumber"" value:
//     ""all"": show on all views (default)
// ""speaker"": only show slide numbers on speaker notes view
//   ""print"": only show slide numbers when printing to PDF
Reveal.configure({ showSlideNumber: 'speaker' });
Overview mode
Press »ESC« or »O« keys to toggle the overview mode on and off. While you're in this mode, you can still navigate between slides,
as if you were at 1,000 feet above your presentation. The overview mode comes with a few API hooks:
Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewshown', function( event ) { /* ... */ } );
Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewhidden', function( event ) { /* ... */ } );

// Toggle the overview mode programmatically
Reveal.toggleOverview();
Fullscreen mode
Just press »F« on your keyboard to show your presentation in fullscreen mode. Press the »ESC« key to exit fullscreen mode.
Embedded media
Add data-autoplay to your media element if you want it to automatically start playing when the slide is shown:
<video data-autoplay src=""http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4""></video>
If you want to enable or disable autoplay globally, for all embedded media, you can use the autoPlayMedia configuration option. If you set this to true ALL media will autoplay regardless of individual data-autoplay attributes. If you initialize with autoPlayMedia: false NO media will autoplay.
Note that embedded HTML5 <video>/<audio> and YouTube/Vimeo iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a slide. This can be disabled by decorating your element with a data-ignore attribute.
Embedded iframes
reveal.js automatically pushes two post messages to embedded iframes. slide:start when the slide containing the iframe is made visible and slide:stop when it is hidden.
Stretching elements
Sometimes it's desirable to have an element, like an image or video, stretch to consume as much space as possible within a given slide. This can be done by adding the .stretch class to an element as seen below:
<section>
	<h2>This video will use up the remaining space on the slide</h2>
    <video class=""stretch"" src=""http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4""></video>
</section>
Limitations:

Only direct descendants of a slide section can be stretched
Only one descendant per slide section can be stretched

Resize Event
When reveal.js changes the scale of the slides it fires a resize event. You can subscribe to the event to resize your elements accordingly.
Reveal.addEventListener( 'resize', function( event ) {
	// event.scale, event.oldScale, event.size
} );
postMessage API
The framework has a built-in postMessage API that can be used when communicating with a presentation inside of another window. Here's an example showing how you'd make a reveal.js instance in the given window proceed to slide 2:
<window>.postMessage( JSON.stringify({ method: 'slide', args: [ 2 ] }), '*' );
When reveal.js runs inside of an iframe it can optionally bubble all of its events to the parent. Bubbled events are stringified JSON with three fields: namespace, eventName and state. Here's how you subscribe to them from the parent window:
window.addEventListener( 'message', function( event ) {
	var data = JSON.parse( event.data );
	if( data.namespace === 'reveal' && data.eventName ==='slidechanged' ) {
		// Slide changed, see data.state for slide number
	}
} );
This cross-window messaging can be toggled on or off using configuration flags.
Reveal.initialize({
	// ...

	// Exposes the reveal.js API through window.postMessage
	postMessage: true,

	// Dispatches all reveal.js events to the parent window through postMessage
	postMessageEvents: false
});
PDF Export
Presentations can be exported to PDF via a special print stylesheet. This feature requires that you use Google Chrome or Chromium and to be serving the presentation from a web server.
Here's an example of an exported presentation that's been uploaded to SlideShare: http://www.slideshare.net/hakimel/revealjs-300.
Separate pages for fragments
Fragments are printed on separate slides by default. Meaning if you have a slide with three fragment steps, it will generate three separate slides where the fragments appear incrementally.
If you prefer printing all fragments in their visible states on the same slide you can set the pdfSeparateFragments config option to false.
Page size
Export dimensions are inferred from the configured presentation size. Slides that are too tall to fit within a single page will expand onto multiple pages. You can limit how many pages a slide may expand onto using the pdfMaxPagesPerSlide config option, for example Reveal.configure({ pdfMaxPagesPerSlide: 1 }) ensures that no slide ever grows to more than one printed page.
Print stylesheet
To enable the PDF print capability in your presentation, the special print stylesheet at /css/print/pdf.css must be loaded. The default index.html file handles this for you when print-pdf is included in the query string. If you're using a different HTML template, you can add this to your HEAD:
<script>
	var link = document.createElement( 'link' );
	link.rel = 'stylesheet';
	link.type = 'text/css';
	link.href = window.location.search.match( /print-pdf/gi ) ? 'css/print/pdf.css' : 'css/print/paper.css';
	document.getElementsByTagName( 'head' )[0].appendChild( link );

Open your presentation with print-pdf included in the query string i.e. http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf. You can test this with revealjs.com?print-pdf.


If you want to include speaker notes in your export, you can append showNotes=true to the query string: http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf&showNotes=true


Open the in-browser print dialog (CTRL/CMD+P).
Change the Destination setting to Save as PDF.
Change the Layout to Landscape.
Change the Margins to None.
Enable the Background graphics option.
Click Save.


Alternatively you can use the decktape project.
Theming
The framework comes with a few different themes included:

black: Black background, white text, blue links (default theme)
white: White background, black text, blue links
league: Gray background, white text, blue links (default theme for reveal.js < 3.0.0)
beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links
sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links
night: Black background, thick white text, orange links
serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links
simple: White background, black text, blue links
solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links

Each theme is available as a separate stylesheet. To change theme you will need to replace black below with your desired theme name in index.html:
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/theme/black.css"" id=""theme"">
If you want to add a theme of your own see the instructions here: /css/theme/README.md.
Speaker Notes
reveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Press the »S« key on your keyboard to open the notes window.
A speaker timer starts as soon as the speaker view is opened. You can reset it to 00:00:00 at any time by simply clicking/tapping on it.
Notes are defined by appending an <aside> element to a slide as seen below. You can add the data-markdown attribute to the aside element if you prefer writing notes using Markdown.
Alternatively you can add your notes in a data-notes attribute on the slide. Like <section data-notes=""Something important""></section>.
When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js runs from a local web server.
<section>
	<h2>Some Slide</h2>

	<aside class=""notes"">
		Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit »S« on your keyboard).
	</aside>
</section>
If you're using the external Markdown plugin, you can add notes with the help of a special delimiter:
<section data-markdown=""example.md"" data-separator=""^\n\n\n"" data-separator-vertical=""^\n\n"" data-separator-notes=""^Note:""></section>

# Title
## Sub-title

Here is some content...

Note:
This will only display in the notes window.
Share and Print Speaker Notes
Notes are only visible to the speaker inside of the speaker view. If you wish to share your notes with others you can initialize reveal.js with the showNotes configuration value set to true. Notes will appear along the bottom of the presentations.
When showNotes is enabled notes are also included when you export to PDF. By default, notes are printed in a box on top of the slide. If you'd rather print them on a separate page, after the slide, set showNotes: ""separate-page"".
Speaker notes clock and timers
The speaker notes window will also show:

Time elapsed since the beginning of the presentation.  If you hover the mouse above this section, a timer reset button will appear.
Current wall-clock time
(Optionally) a pacing timer which indicates whether the current pace of the presentation is on track for the right timing (shown in green), and if not, whether the presenter should speed up (shown in red) or has the luxury of slowing down (blue).

The pacing timer can be enabled by configuring by the defaultTiming parameter in the Reveal configuration block, which specifies the number of seconds per slide.  120 can be a reasonable rule of thumb.  Timings can also be given per slide <section> by setting the data-timing attribute.  Both values are in numbers of seconds.
Server Side Speaker Notes
In some cases it can be desirable to run notes on a separate device from the one you're presenting on. The Node.js-based notes plugin lets you do this using the same note definitions as its client side counterpart. Include the required scripts by adding the following dependencies:
Reveal.initialize({
	// ...

	dependencies: [
		{ src: 'socket.io/socket.io.js', async: true },
		{ src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true }
	]
});
Then:

Install Node.js (4.0.0 or later)
Run npm install
Run node plugin/notes-server

Plugins
Plugins should register themselves with reveal.js by calling Reveal.registerPlugin( 'myPluginID', MyPlugin ). Registered plugin instances can optionally expose an ""init"" function that reveal.js will call to initialize them.
When reveal.js is booted up via Reveal.initialize(), it will go through all registered plugins and invoke their ""init"" methods. If the ""init"" method returns a Promise, reveal.js will wait for that promise to be fullfilled before finshing the startup sequence and firing the ready event. Here's an example of a plugin that does some asynchronous work before reveal.js can proceed:
let MyPlugin = {
	init: () =>  new Promise( resolve => setTimeout( resolve, 3000 ) )
};
Reveal.registerPlugin( 'myPlugin', MyPlugin );
Reveal.addEventListener( 'ready', () => console.log( 'Three seconds later...' ) );
Reveal.initialize();
If the init method does not return a Promise, the plugin is considered ready right away and will not hold up the reveal.js startup sequence.
Retrieving Plugins
If you want to check if a specific plugin is registered you can use the Reveal.hasPlugin method and pass in a plugin ID, for example: Reveal.hasPlugin( 'myPlugin' ). If you want to retrieve a plugin instance you can use Reveal.getPlugin( 'myPlugin' ).
Multiplexing
The multiplex plugin allows your audience to view the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet or laptop. As the master presentation navigates the slides, all client presentations will update in real time. See a demo at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/.
The multiplex plugin needs the following 3 things to operate:

Master presentation that has control
Client presentations that follow the master
Socket.io server to broadcast events from the master to the clients

Master presentation
Served from a static file server accessible (preferably) only to the presenter. This need only be on your (the presenter's) computer. (It's safer to run the master presentation from your own computer, so if the venue's Internet goes down it doesn't stop the show.) An example would be to execute the following commands in the directory of your master presentation:

npm install node-static
static

If you want to use the speaker notes plugin with your master presentation then make sure you have the speaker notes plugin configured correctly along with the configuration shown below, then execute node plugin/notes-server in the directory of your master presentation. The configuration below will cause it to connect to the socket.io server as a master, as well as launch your speaker-notes/static-file server.
You can then access your master presentation at http://localhost:1947
Example configuration:
Reveal.initialize({
	// other options...

	multiplex: {
		// Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.
		secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation
		id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server
		url: 'https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh' // Location of socket.io server
	},

	// Don't forget to add the dependencies
	dependencies: [
		{ src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.2.0/socket.io.js', async: true },
		{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true },

		// and if you want speaker notes
		{ src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true }

		// other dependencies...
	]
});
Client presentation
Served from a publicly accessible static file server. Examples include: GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, Dreamhost, Akamai, etc. The more reliable, the better. Your audience can then access the client presentation via http://example.com/path/to/presentation/client/index.html, with the configuration below causing them to connect to the socket.io server as clients.
Example configuration:
Reveal.initialize({
	// other options...

	multiplex: {
		// Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.
		secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation
		id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server
		url: 'https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh' // Location of socket.io server
	},

	// Don't forget to add the dependencies
	dependencies: [
		{ src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.2.0/socket.io.js', async: true },
		{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }

		// other dependencies...
	]
});
Socket.io server
Server that receives the slideChanged events from the master presentation and broadcasts them out to the connected client presentations. This needs to be publicly accessible. You can run your own socket.io server with the commands:

npm install
node plugin/multiplex

Or you can use the socket.io server at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/.
You'll need to generate a unique secret and token pair for your master and client presentations. To do so, visit http://example.com/token, where http://example.com is the location of your socket.io server. Or if you're going to use the socket.io server at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/, visit https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/token.
You are very welcome to point your presentations at the Socket.io server running at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/, but availability and stability are not guaranteed.
For anything mission critical I recommend you run your own server. The easiest way to do this is by installing now. With that installed, deploying your own Multiplex server is as easy running the following command from the reveal.js folder: now plugin/multiplex.
socket.io server as file static server
The socket.io server can play the role of static file server for your client presentation, as in the example at https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/. (Open https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match.)
Example configuration:
Reveal.initialize({
	// other options...

	multiplex: {
		// Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.
		secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation
		id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server
		url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server
	},

	// Don't forget to add the dependencies
	dependencies: [
		{ src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.2.0/socket.io.js', async: true },
		{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }

		// other dependencies...
	]
It can also play the role of static file server for your master presentation and client presentations at the same time (as long as you don't want to use speaker notes). (Open https://reveal-js-multiplex-ccjbegmaii.now.sh/ in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match. Navigate through the slides on the second, and the first will update to match.) This is probably not desirable, because you don't want your audience to mess with your slides while you're presenting. ;)
Example configuration:
Reveal.initialize({
	// other options...

	multiplex: {
		// Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions.
		secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation
		id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server
		url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server
	},

	// Don't forget to add the dependencies
	dependencies: [
		{ src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.2.0/socket.io.js', async: true },
		{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true },
		{ src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true }

		// other dependencies...
	]
});
MathJax
If you want to display math equations in your presentation you can easily do so by including this plugin. The plugin is a very thin wrapper around the MathJax library. To use it you'll need to include it as a reveal.js dependency, find our more about dependencies here.
The plugin defaults to using LaTeX but that can be adjusted through the math configuration object. Note that MathJax is loaded from a remote server. If you want to use it offline you'll need to download a copy of the library and adjust the mathjax configuration value.
Below is an example of how the plugin can be configured. If you don't intend to change these values you do not need to include the math config object at all.
Reveal.initialize({
	// other options ...

	math: {
		mathjax: 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js',
		config: 'TeX-AMS_HTML-full'  // See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/config-files.html
		// pass other options into `MathJax.Hub.Config()`
		TeX: { Macros: macros }
	},

	dependencies: [
		{ src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true }
	]
});
Read MathJax's documentation if you need HTTPS delivery or serving of specific versions for stability.
MathJax in Markdown
If you want to include math inside of a presentation written in Markdown you need to wrap the formula in backticks. This prevents syntax conflicts between LaTeX and Markdown. For example:
`$$ J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \sum_{i=0} $$`

🔌 Adapter
ary
Creates a function that accepts up to n arguments, ignoring any additional arguments.
Call the provided function, fn, with up to n arguments, using Array.prototype.slice(0,n) and the spread operator (...).
const ary = (fn, n) => (...args) => fn(...args.slice(0, n));

Examples
const firstTwoMax = ary(Math.max, 2);
[[2, 6, 'a'], [8, 4, 6], [10]].map(x => firstTwoMax(...x)); // [6, 8, 10]

⬆ Back to top
call
Given a key and a set of arguments, call them when given a context. Primarily useful in composition.
Use a closure to call a stored key with stored arguments.
const call = (key, ...args) => context => context[key](...args);

Examples
Promise.resolve([1, 2, 3])
  .then(call('map', x => 2 * x))
  .then(console.log); // [ 2, 4, 6 ]
const map = call.bind(null, 'map');
Promise.resolve([1, 2, 3])
  .then(map(x => 2 * x))
  .then(console.log); // [ 2, 4, 6 ]

⬆ Back to top
collectInto
Changes a function that accepts an array into a variadic function.
Given a function, return a closure that collects all inputs into an array-accepting function.
const collectInto = fn => (...args) => fn(args);

Examples
const Pall = collectInto(Promise.all.bind(Promise));
let p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
let p2 = Promise.resolve(2);
let p3 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000, 3));
Pall(p1, p2, p3).then(console.log); // [1, 2, 3] (after about 2 seconds)

⬆ Back to top
flip
Flip takes a function as an argument, then makes the first argument the last.
Return a closure that takes variadic inputs, and splices the last argument to make it the first argument before applying the rest.
const flip = fn => (first, ...rest) => fn(...rest, first);

Examples
let a = { name: 'John Smith' };
let b = {};
const mergeFrom = flip(Object.assign);
let mergePerson = mergeFrom.bind(null, a);
mergePerson(b); // == b
b = {};
Object.assign(b, a); // == b

⬆ Back to top
over
Creates a function that invokes each provided function with the arguments it receives and returns the results.
Use Array.prototype.map() and Function.prototype.apply() to apply each function to the given arguments.
const over = (...fns) => (...args) => fns.map(fn => fn.apply(null, args));

Examples
const minMax = over(Math.min, Math.max);
minMax(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // [1,5]

⬆ Back to top
overArgs
Creates a function that invokes the provided function with its arguments transformed.
Use Array.prototype.map() to apply transforms to args in combination with the spread operator (...) to pass the transformed arguments to fn.
const overArgs = (fn, transforms) => (...args) => fn(...args.map((val, i) => transforms[i](val)));

Examples
const square = n => n * n;
const double = n => n * 2;
const fn = overArgs((x, y) => [x, y], [square, double]);
fn(9, 3); // [81, 6]

⬆ Back to top
pipeAsyncFunctions
Performs left-to-right function composition for asynchronous functions.
Use Array.prototype.reduce() with the spread operator (...) to perform left-to-right function composition using Promise.then().
The functions can return a combination of: simple values, Promise's, or they can be defined as async ones returning through await.
All functions must be unary.
const pipeAsyncFunctions = (...fns) => arg => fns.reduce((p, f) => p.then(f), Promise.resolve(arg));

Examples
const sum = pipeAsyncFunctions(
  x => x + 1,
  x => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(x + 2), 1000)),
  x => x + 3,
  async x => (await x) + 4
);
(async() => {
  console.log(await sum(5)); // 15 (after one second)
})();

⬆ Back to top
pipeFunctions
Performs left-to-right function composition.

Maps the values of an array to an object using a function, where the key-value pairs consist of the original value as the key and the mapped value.
Use an anonymous inner function scope to declare an undefined memory space, using closures to store a return value. Use a new Array to store the array with a map of the function over its data set and a comma operator to return a second step, without needing to move from one context to another (due to closures and order of operations).
const mapObject = (arr, fn) =>
  (a => (
    (a = [arr, arr.map(fn)]), a[0].reduce((acc, val, ind) => ((acc[val] = a[1][ind]), acc), {})
  ))();

Examples
const squareIt = arr => mapObject(arr, a => a * a);
squareIt([1, 2, 3]); // { 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9 }

maxN
Returns the n maximum elements from the provided array.
If n is greater than or equal to the provided array's length, then return the original array (sorted in descending order).
Use Array.prototype.sort() combined with the spread operator (...) to create a shallow clone of the array and sort it in descending order.
Use Array.prototype.slice() to get the specified number of elements.
Omit the second argument, n, to get a one-element array.
const maxN = (arr, n = 1) => [...arr].sort((a, b) => b - a).slice(0, n);

Examples
maxN([1, 2, 3]); // [3]
maxN([1, 2, 3], 2); // [3,2]

Examples
nthElement(['a', 'b', 'c'], 1); // 'b'
nthElement(['a', 'b', 'b'], -3); // 'a'

⬆ Back to top
offset
Moves the specified amount of elements to the end of the array.
Use Array.prototype.slice() twice to get the elements after the specified index and the elements before that.
Use the spread operator(...) to combine the two into one array.
If offset is negative, the elements will be moved from end to start.
const offset = (arr, offset) => [...arr.slice(offset), ...arr.slice(0, offset)];

Examples
offset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2); // [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

permutations 
⚠️ WARNING: This function's execution time increases exponentially with each array element. Anything more than 8 to 10 entries will cause your browser to hang as it tries to solve all the different combinations.
Generates all permutations of an array's elements (contains duplicates).
Use recursion.
For each element in the given array, create all the partial permutations for the rest of its elements.
Use Array.prototype.map() to combine the element with each partial permutation, then Array.prototype.reduce() to combine all permutations in one array.
Base cases are for array length equal to 2 or 1.
const permutations = arr => {
  if (arr.length <= 2) return arr.length === 2 ? [arr, [arr[1], arr[0]]] : arr;
  return arr.reduce(
    (acc, item, i) =>

uniqueSymmetricDifference
Returns the unique symmetric difference between two arrays, not containing duplicate values from either array.
Use Array.prototype.filter() and Array.prototype.includes() on each array to remove values contained in the other, then create a Set from the results, removing duplicate values.
const uniqueSymmetricDifference = (a, b) => [
  ...new Set([...a.filter(v => !b.includes(v)), ...b.filter(v => !a.includes(v))])
];

Examples

unzip
Creates an array of arrays, ungrouping the elements in an array produced by zip.
Use Math.max.apply() to get the longest subarray in the array, Array.prototype.map() to make each element an array.
Use Array.prototype.reduce() and Array.prototype.forEach() to map grouped values to individual arrays.
const unzip = arr =>
  arr.reduce(
    (acc, val) => (val.forEach((v, i) => acc[i].push(v)), acc),
    Array.from({
      length: Math.max(...arr.map(x => x.length))
    }).map(x => [])
  );

Examples
unzip([['a', 1, true], ['b', 2, false]]); // [['a', 'b'], [1, 2], [true, false]]
unzip([['a', 1, true], ['b', 2]]); // [['a', 'b'], [1, 2], [true]]

⬆ Back to top
unzipWith 
Creates an array of elements, ungrouping the elements in an array produced by zip and applying the provided function.
Use Math.max.apply() to get the longest subarray in the array, Array.prototype.map() to make each element an array.
Use Array.prototype.reduce() and Array.prototype.forEach() to map grouped values to individual arrays.
Use Array.prototype.map() and the spread operator (...) to apply fn to each individual group of elements.
const unzipWith = (arr, fn) =>
  arr
    .reduce(
      (acc, val) => (val.forEach((v, i) => acc[i].push(v)), acc),

without
Filters out the elements of an array, that have one of the specified values.
Use Array.prototype.filter() to create an array excluding(using !Array.includes()) all given values.
(For a snippet that mutates the original array see pull)
const without = (arr, ...args) => arr.filter(v => !args.includes(v));

Examples
without([2, 1, 2, 3], 1, 2); // [3]

⬆ Back to top
zip
Creates an array of elements, grouped based on the position in the original arrays.
Use Math.max.apply() to get the longest array in the arguments.
Creates an array with that length as return value and use Array.from() with a map-function to create an array of grouped elements.
If lengths of the argument-arrays vary, undefined is used where no value could be found.
const zip = (...arrays) => {
  const maxLength = Math.max(...arrays.map(x => x.length));
  return Array.from({ length: maxLength }).map((_, i) => {
    return Array.from({ length: arrays.length }, (_, k) => arrays[k][i]);
  });
};

Examples
zip(['a', 'b'], [1, 2], [true, false]); // [['a', 1, true], ['b', 2, false]]

⬆ Back to top
zipObject
Given an array of valid property identifiers and an array of values, return an object associating the properties to the values.
Since an object can have undefined values but not undefined property pointers, the array of properties is used to decide the structure of the resulting object using Array.prototype.reduce().
const zipObject = (props, values) =>
  props.reduce((obj, prop, index) => ((obj[prop] = values[index]), obj), {});

Examples
zipObject(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2]); // {a: 1, b: 2, c: undefined}
zipObject(['a', 'b'], [1, 2, 3]); // {a: 1, b: 2}

⬆ Back to top
zipWith 
Creates an array of elements, grouped based on the position in the original arrays and using function as the last value to specify how grouped values should be combined.
Check if the last argument provided is a function.
Use Math.max() to get the longest array in the arguments.
Creates an array with that length as return value and use Array.from() with a map-function to create an array of grouped elements.
If lengths of the argument-arrays vary, undefined is used where no value could be found.
The function is invoked with the elements of each group (...group).
const zipWith = (...array) => {
  const fn = typeof array[array.length - 1] === 'function' ? array.pop() : undefined;
  return Array.from(
    { length: Math.max(...array.map(a => a.length)) },
    (_, i) => (fn ? fn(...array.map(a => a[i])) : array.map(a => a[i]))
  );
};

Examples
zipWith([1, 2], [10, 20], [100, 200], (a, b, c) => a + b + c); // [111,222]
zipWith(
  [1, 2, 3],
  [10, 20],
  [100, 200],
  (a, b, c) => (a != null ? a : 'a') + (b != null ? b : 'b') + (c != null ? c : 'c')
); // [111, 222, '3bc']

copyToClipboard 
⚠️ NOTICE: The same functionality can be easily implemented by using the new asynchronous Clipboard API, which is still experimental but should be used in the future instead of this snippet. Find out more about it here.
Copy a string to the clipboard.
Only works as a result of user action (i.e. inside a click event listener).
Create a new <textarea> element, fill it with the supplied data and add it to the HTML document.
Use Selection.getRangeAt()to store the selected range (if any).
Use document.execCommand('copy') to copy to the clipboard.
Remove the <textarea> element from the HTML document.
Finally, use Selection().addRange() to recover the original selected range (if any).
const copyToClipboard = str => {
  const el = document.createElement('textarea');
  el.value = str;
  el.setAttribute('readonly', '');
  el.style.position = 'absolute';
  el.style.left = '-9999px';
  document.body.appendChild(el);
  const selected =
    document.getSelection().rangeCount > 0 ? document.getSelection().getRangeAt(0) : false;
  el.select();
  document.execCommand('copy');
  document.body.removeChild(el);
  if (selected) {
    document.getSelection().removeAllRanges();
    document.getSelection().addRange(selected);
  }
};

Examples
copyToClipboard('Lorem ipsum'); // 'Lorem ipsum' copied to clipboard.

counter 
Creates a counter with the specified range, step and duration for the specified selector.
Check if step has the proper sign and change it accordingly.
Use setInterval() in combination with Math.abs() and Math.floor() to calculate the time between each new text draw.
Use document.querySelector().innerHTML to update the value of the selected element.
Omit the fourth parameter, step, to use a default step of 1.
Omit the fifth parameter, duration, to use a default duration of 2000ms.
const counter = (selector, start, end, step = 1, duration = 2000) => {
  let current = start,
    _step = (end - start) * step < 0 ? -step : step,
    timer = setInterval(() => {
      current += _step;
      document.querySelector(selector).innerHTML = current;
      if (current >= end) document.querySelector(selector).innerHTML = end;
      if (current >= end) clearInterval(timer);
    }, Math.abs(Math.floor(duration / (end - start))));
  return timer;
};

Examples
counter('#my-id', 1, 1000, 5, 2000); // Creates a 2-second timer for the element with id=""my-id""

createElement
Creates an element from a string (without appending it to the document).
If the given string contains multiple elements, only the first one will be returned.
Use document.createElement() to create a new element.
Set its innerHTML to the string supplied as the argument.
Use ParentNode.firstElementChild to return the element version of the string.
const createElement = str => {
  const el = document.createElement('div');
  el.innerHTML = str;
  return el.firstElementChild;
};

Examples
const el = createElement(
  `<div class=""container"">
    <p>Hello!</p>
  </div>`
);
console.log(el.className); // 'container'

⬆ Back to top
createEventHub 
Creates a pub/sub (publish–subscribe) event hub with emit, on, and off methods.
Use Object.create(null) to create an empty hub object that does not inherit properties from Object.prototype.
For emit, resolve the array of handlers based on the event argument and then run each one with Array.prototype.forEach() by passing in the data as an argument.
For on, create an array for the event if it does not yet exist, then use Array.prototype.push() to add the handler
to the array.
For off, use Array.prototype.findIndex() to find the index of the handler in the event array and remove it using Array.prototype.splice().
const createEventHub = () => ({
  hub: Object.create(null),
  emit(event, data) {
    (this.hub[event] || []).forEach(handler => handler(data));
  },
  on(event, handler) {
    if (!this.hub[event]) this.hub[event] = [];
    this.hub[event].push(handler);
  },
  off(event, handler) {
    const i = (this.hub[event] || []).findIndex(h => h === handler);
    if (i > -1) this.hub[event].splice(i, 1);
  }
});

Examples
const handler = data => console.log(data);
const hub = createEventHub();
let increment = 0;

// Subscribe: listen for different types of events
hub.on('message', handler);
hub.on('message', () => console.log('Message event fired'));
hub.on('increment', () => increment++);

// Publish: emit events to invoke all handlers subscribed to them, passing the data to them as an argument
hub.emit('message', 'hello world'); // logs 'hello world' and 'Message event fired'
hub.emit('message', { hello: 'world' }); // logs the object and 'Message event fired'
hub.emit('increment'); // `increment` variable is now 1

// Unsubscribe: stop a specific handler from listening to the 'message' event
hub.off('message', handler);

elementIsVisibleInViewport 
Returns true if the element specified is visible in the viewport, false otherwise.
Use Element.getBoundingClientRect() and the window.inner(Width|Height) values
to determine if a given element is visible in the viewport.
Omit the second argument to determine if the element is entirely visible, or specify true to determine if
it is partially visible.
const elementIsVisibleInViewport = (el, partiallyVisible = false) => {
  const { top, left, bottom, right } = el.getBoundingClientRect();
  const { innerHeight, innerWidth } = window;
  return partiallyVisible
    ? ((top > 0 && top < innerHeight) || (bottom > 0 && bottom < innerHeight)) &&
        ((left > 0 && left < innerWidth) || (right > 0 && right < innerWidth))
    : top >= 0 && left >= 0 && bottom <= innerHeight && right <= innerWidth;
};

Examples
// e.g. 100x100 viewport and a 10x10px element at position {top: -1, left: 0, bottom: 9, right: 10}

document.body.addEventListener('click', fn);
off(document.body, 'click', fn); // no longer logs '!' upon clicking on the page

⬆ Back to top
on
Adds an event listener to an element with the ability to use event delegation.
Use EventTarget.addEventListener() to add an event listener to an element. If there is a target property supplied to the options object, ensure the event target matches the target specified and then invoke the callback by supplying the correct this context.
Returns a reference to the custom delegator function, in order to be possible to use with off.
Omit opts to default to non-delegation behavior and event bubbling.
const on = (el, evt, fn, opts = {}) => {
  const delegatorFn = e => e.target.matches(opts.target) && fn.call(e.target, e);
  el.addEventListener(evt, opts.target ? delegatorFn : fn, opts.options || false);

};

Examples
const fn = () => console.log('!');
on(document.body, 'click', fn); // logs '!' upon clicking the body
on(document.body, 'click', fn, { target: 'p' }); // logs '!' upon clicking a `p` element child of the body
on(document.body, 'click', fn, { options: true }); // use capturing instead of bubbling

⬆ Back to top
onUserInputChange 
Run the callback whenever the user input type changes (mouse or touch). Useful for enabling/disabling code depending on the input device. This process is dynamic and works with hybrid devices (e.g. touchscreen laptops).
Use two event listeners. Assume mouse input initially and bind a touchstart event listener to the document.
On touchstart, add a mousemove event listener to listen for two consecutive mousemove events firing within 20ms, using performance.now().
Run the callback with the input type as an argument in either of these situations.
const onUserInputChange = callback => {
  let type = 'mouse',
    lastTime = 0;
  const mousemoveHandler = () => {
    const now = performance.now();
    if (now - lastTime < 20)
      (type = 'mouse'), callback(type), document.removeEventListener('mousemove', mousemoveHandler);
    lastTime = now;
  };
  document.addEventListener('touchstart', () => {
    if (type === 'touch') return;
    (type = 'touch'), callback(type), document.addEventListener('mousemove', mousemoveHandler);

Examples
onUserInputChange(type => {
  console.log('The user is now using', type, 'as an input method.');
});

prefix
Returns the prefixed version (if necessary) of a CSS property that the browser supports.
Use Array.prototype.findIndex() on an array of vendor prefix strings to test if document.body has one of them defined in its CSSStyleDeclaration object, otherwise return null.
Use String.prototype.charAt() and String.prototype.toUpperCase() to capitalize the property, which will be appended to the vendor prefix string.
const prefix = prop => {
  const capitalizedProp = prop.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + prop.slice(1);
  const prefixes = ['', 'webkit', 'moz', 'ms', 'o'];
  const i = prefixes.findIndex(
    prefix => typeof document.body.style[prefix ? prefix + capitalizedProp : prop] !== 'undefined'
  );
  return i !== -1 ? (i === 0 ? prop : prefixes[i] + capitalizedProp) : null;

recordAnimationFrames
Invokes the provided callback on each animation frame.
Use recursion.
Provided that running is true, continue invoking window.requestAnimationFrame() which invokes the provided callback.
Return an object with two methods start and stop to allow manual control of the recording.

Return a promise, listening for onmessage and onerror events and resolving the data posted back from the worker, or throwing an error.
const runAsync = fn => {
  const worker = new Worker(
    URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([`postMessage((${fn})());`]), {
      type: 'application/javascript; charset=utf-8'
    })

    for (let j = 0; j < 700; j++) for (let k = 0; k < 300; k++) result = result + i + j + k;

  return result;
};
/*
  NOTE: Since the function is running in a different context, closures are not supported.
  The function supplied to `runAsync` gets stringified, so everything becomes literal.
  All variables and functions must be defined inside.
*/
runAsync(longRunningFunction).then(console.log); // 209685000000
runAsync(() => 10 ** 3).then(console.log); // 1000

    console.log(text);
  },
  1000,
  'later'
); // Logs 'later' after one second.

functionName
Logs the name of a function.
Use console.debug() and the name property of the passed method to log the method's name to the debug channel of the console.
const functionName = fn => (console.debug(fn.name), fn);

Examples
functionName(Math.max); // max (logged in debug channel of console)

⬆ Back to top
hz
Returns the number of times a function executed per second.
hz is the unit for hertz, the unit of frequency defined as one cycle per second.
Use performance.now() to get the difference in milliseconds before and after the iteration loop to calculate the time elapsed executing the function iterations times.
Return the number of cycles per second by converting milliseconds to seconds and dividing it by the time elapsed.
Omit the second argument, iterations, to use the default of 100 iterations.
const hz = (fn, iterations = 100) => {
  const before = performance.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < iterations; i++) fn();
  return (1000 * iterations) / (performance.now() - before);
};

Examples
// 10,000 element array
const numbers = Array(10000)
  .fill()
  .map((_, i) => i);

// Test functions with the same goal: sum up the elements in the array
const sumReduce = () => numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
const sumForLoop = () => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) sum += numbers[i];

memoize 
Returns the memoized (cached) function.
Create an empty cache by instantiating a new Map object.
Return a function which takes a single argument to be supplied to the memoized function by first checking if the function's output for that specific input value is already cached, or store and return it if not. The function keyword must be used in order to allow the memoized function to have its this context changed if necessary.
Allow access to the cache by setting it as a property on the returned function.
const memoize = fn => {
  const cache = new Map();
  const cached = function(val) {
    return cache.has(val) ? cache.get(val) : cache.set(val, fn.call(this, val)) && cache.get(val);
  };
  cached.cache = cache;
  return cached;
};

Examples
// See the `anagrams` snippet.
const anagramsCached = memoize(anagrams);
anagramsCached('javascript'); // takes a long time
anagramsCached('javascript'); // returns virtually instantly since it's now cached
console.log(anagramsCached.cache); // The cached anagrams map

once
Ensures a function is called only once.
Utilizing a closure, use a flag, called, and set it to true once the function is called for the first time, preventing it from being called again. In order to allow the function to have its this context changed (such as in an event listener), the function keyword must be used, and the supplied function must have the context applied.
Allow the function to be supplied with an arbitrary number of arguments using the rest/spread (...) operator.
const once = fn => {
  let called = false;
  return function(...args) {
    if (called) return;
    called = true;

equals 
Performs a deep comparison between two values to determine if they are equivalent.
Check if the two values are identical, if they are both Date objects with the same time, using Date.getTime() or if they are both non-object values with an equivalent value (strict comparison).
Check if only one value is null or undefined or if their prototypes differ.
If none of the above conditions are met, use Object.keys() to check if both values have the same number of keys, then use Array.prototype.every() to check if every key in the first value exists in the second one and if they are equivalent by calling this method recursively.
const equals = (a, b) => {
  if (a === b) return true;
  if (a instanceof Date && b instanceof Date) return a.getTime() === b.getTime();
  if (!a || !b || (typeof a !== 'object' && typeof b !== 'object')) return a === b;

flattenObject
Flatten an object with the paths for keys.
Use recursion.
Use Object.keys(obj) combined with Array.prototype.reduce() to convert every leaf node to a flattened path node.
If the value of a key is an object, the function calls itself with the appropriate prefix to create the path using Object.assign().
Otherwise, it adds the appropriate prefixed key-value pair to the accumulator object.
You should always omit the second argument, prefix, unless you want every key to have a prefix.
const flattenObject = (obj, prefix = '') =>
  Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, k) => {
    const pre = prefix.length ? prefix + '.' : '';
    if (typeof obj[k] === 'object') Object.assign(acc, flattenObject(obj[k], pre + k));

const functions = (obj, inherited = false) =>
  (inherited
    ? [...Object.keys(obj), ...Object.keys(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj))]

nest
Given a flat array of objects linked to one another, it will nest them recursively.
Useful for nesting comments, such as the ones on reddit.com.
Use recursion.
Use Array.prototype.filter() to filter the items where the id matches the link, then Array.prototype.map() to map each one to a new object that has a children property which recursively nests the items based on which ones are children of the current item.
Omit the second argument, id, to default to null which indicates the object is not linked to another one (i.e. it is a top level object).
Omit the third argument, link, to use 'parent_id' as the default property which links the object to another one by its id.
const nest = (items, id = null, link = 'parent_id') =>
  items
    .filter(item => item[link] === id)
    .map(item => ({ ...item, children: nest(items, item.id) }));

Examples
// One top level comment
const comments = [

const yesNo = (val, def = false) =>
  /^(y|yes)$/i.test(val) ? true : /^(n|no)$/i.test(val) ? false : def;

Examples
yesNo('Y'); // true
yesNo('yes'); // true
yesNo('No'); // false
yesNo('Foo', true); // true

Flask
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed
to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug
and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web
application frameworks.
Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or
project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and
libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the
community that make adding new functionality easy.

Installing
Install and update using pip:
pip install -U Flask


A Simple Example
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
$ env FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run
 * Serving Flask app ""hello""
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability in Express, please see Security Policies and Procedures.
Quick Start
The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable express(1) to generate an application as shown below:
Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:
$ npm install -g express-generator@4
Create the app:
$ express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
Install dependencies:
$ npm install
Start the server:
$ npm start
Philosophy
The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public
HTTP APIs.
Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
14 template engines via Consolidate.js,
you can quickly craft your perfect framework.
Examples
To view the examples, clone the Express repo and install the dependencies:
$ git clone git://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1
$ cd express
$ npm install
Then run whichever example you want:
$ node examples/content-negotiation
Tests
To run the test suite, first install the dependencies, then run npm test:
$ npm install
$ npm test
People
The original author of Express is TJ Holowaychuk
The current lead maintainer is Douglas Christopher Wilson

The Fuck     
The Fuck is a magnificent app, inspired by a @liamosaur
tweet,
that corrects errors in previous console commands.
Is The Fuck too slow? Try the experimental instant mode!

More examples:
➜ apt-get install vim
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?

➜ fuck
sudo apt-get install vim [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
[sudo] password for nvbn:
Reading package lists... Done
...
➜ git push
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master


➜ fuck
git push --set-upstream origin master [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Counting objects: 9, done.
...
➜ puthon
No command 'puthon' found, did you mean:
 Command 'python' from package 'python-minimal' (main)
 Command 'python' from package 'python3' (main)
zsh: command not found: puthon

➜ fuck
python [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Python 3.4.2 (default, Oct  8 2014, 13:08:17)
...
➜ git brnch
git: 'brnch' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
    branch

➜ fuck
git branch [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
* master
➜ lein rpl
'rpl' is not a task. See 'lein help'.

Did you mean this?
         repl

➜ fuck
lein repl [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
nREPL server started on port 54848 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:54848
REPL-y 0.3.1
...
If you're not afraid of blindly running corrected commands, the
require_confirmation settings option can be disabled:
➜ apt-get install vim
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?

➜ fuck
sudo apt-get install vim
[sudo] password for nvbn:
Reading package lists... Done
...
Requirements

python (3.4+)
pip
python-dev

Installation
On OS X, you can install The Fuck via Homebrew (or via Linuxbrew on Linux):
brew install thefuck
On Ubuntu / Mint, install The Fuck with the following commands:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools
sudo pip3 install thefuck
On FreeBSD, install The Fuck with the following commands:
pkg install thefuck
On ChromeOS, install The Fuck using chromebrew with the following command:
crew install thefuck
On other systems, install The Fuck  by using pip:
pip install thefuck
Alternatively, you may use an OS package manager (OS X, Ubuntu, Arch).
#
It is recommended that you place this command in your .bash_profile,
.bashrc, .zshrc or other startup script:
eval $(thefuck --alias)
# You can use whatever you want as an alias, like for Mondays:
eval $(thefuck --alias FUCK)
Or in your shell config (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Powershell, tcsh).
Changes are only available in a new shell session. To make changes immediately
available, run source ~/.bashrc (or your shell config file like .zshrc).
To run fixed commands without confirmation, use the --yeah option (or just -y for short):
fuck --yeah
To fix commands recursively until succeeding, use the -r option:
fuck -r
Updating
pip3 install thefuck --upgrade
Note: Alias functionality was changed in v1.34 of The Fuck

Creating your own rules
To add your own rule, create a file named your-rule-name.py
in ~/.config/thefuck/rules. The rule file must contain two functions:
match(command: Command) -> bool
get_new_command(command: Command) -> str | list[str]
Additionally, rules can contain optional functions:
side_effect(old_command: Command, fixed_command: str) -> None
Rules can also contain the optional variables enabled_by_default, requires_output and priority.
Command has three attributes: script, output and script_parts.
Your rule should not change Command.
Rules api changed in 3.0: To access a rule's settings, import it with
from thefuck.conf import settings
settings is a special object assembled from ~/.config/thefuck/settings.py,
and values from env (see more below).
A simple example rule for running a script with sudo:
def match(command):
    return ('permission denied' in command.output.lower()
            or 'EACCES' in command.output)


def get_new_command(command):
    return 'sudo {}'.format(command.script)

# Optional:
enabled_by_default = True

def side_effect(command, fixed_command):
    subprocess.call('chmod 777 .', shell=True)

priority = 1000  # Lower first, default is 1000

requires_output = True
More examples of rules,
utility functions for rules,
app/os-specific helpers.
Settings
Several The Fuck parameters can be changed in the file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/thefuck/settings.py
($XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config):

rules – list of enabled rules, by default thefuck.conf.DEFAULT_RULES;
exclude_rules – list of disabled rules, by default [];
require_confirmation – requires confirmation before running new command, by default True;
wait_command – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output;
no_colors – disable colored output;
priority – dict with rules priorities, rule with lower priority will be matched first;
debug – enables debug output, by default False;
history_limit – numeric value of how many history commands will be scanned, like 2000;
alter_history – push fixed command to history, by default True;
wait_slow_command – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output if it in slow_commands list;
slow_commands – list of slow commands;
num_close_matches – maximum number of close matches to suggest, by default 3.

An example of settings.py:
rules = ['sudo', 'no_command']
exclude_rules = ['git_push']
require_confirmation = True
wait_command = 10
no_colors = False
priority = {'sudo': 100, 'no_command': 9999}
debug = False
history_limit = 9999
wait_slow_command = 20
slow_commands = ['react-native', 'gradle']
num_close_matches = 5
Or via environment variables:

THEFUCK_RULES – list of enabled rules, like DEFAULT_RULES:rm_root or sudo:no_command;
THEFUCK_EXCLUDE_RULES – list of disabled rules, like git_pull:git_push;
THEFUCK_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION – require confirmation before running new command, true/false;
THEFUCK_WAIT_COMMAND – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output;
THEFUCK_NO_COLORS – disable colored output, true/false;
THEFUCK_PRIORITY – priority of the rules, like no_command=9999:apt_get=100,
rule with lower priority will be matched first;
THEFUCK_DEBUG – enables debug output, true/false;
THEFUCK_HISTORY_LIMIT – how many history commands will be scanned, like 2000;
THEFUCK_ALTER_HISTORY – push fixed command to history true/false;
THEFUCK_WAIT_SLOW_COMMAND – max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output if it in slow_commands list;
THEFUCK_SLOW_COMMANDS – list of slow commands, like lein:gradle;
THEFUCK_NUM_CLOSE_MATCHES – maximum number of close matches to suggest, like 5.

For example:
export THEFUCK_RULES='sudo:no_command'
export THEFUCK_EXCLUDE_RULES='git_pull:git_push'
export THEFUCK_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION='true'
export THEFUCK_WAIT_COMMAND=10
export THEFUCK_NO_COLORS='false'
export THEFUCK_PRIORITY='no_command=9999:apt_get=100'
export THEFUCK_HISTORY_LIMIT='2000'
export THEFUCK_NUM_CLOSE_MATCHES='5'
Third-party packages with rules
If you'd like to make a specific set of non-public rules, but would still like
to share them with others, create a package named thefuck_contrib_* with
the following structure:
thefuck_contrib_foo
  thefuck_contrib_foo
    rules
      __init__.py
      *third-party rules*
    __init__.py
    *third-party-utils*
  setup.py

The Fuck will find rules located in the rules module.
Experimental instant mode
The default behavior of The Fuck requires time to re-run previous commands.
When in instant mode, The Fuck saves time by logging output with script,
then reading the log.

Currently, instant mode only supports Python 3 with bash or zsh. zsh's autocorrect function also needs to be disabled in order for thefuck to work properly.
To enable instant mode, add --enable-experimental-instant-mode
to the alias initialization in .bashrc, .bash_profile or .zshrc.
For example:
eval $(thefuck --alias --enable-experimental-instant-mode)

Welcome to Rails
What's Rails?
Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to
create database-backed web applications according to the
Model-View-Controller (MVC)
pattern.
Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides your
application into three layers: Model, View, and Controller, each with a specific responsibility.
Model layer
The Model layer represents the domain model (such as Account, Product,
Person, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic specific to
your application. In Rails, database-backed model classes are derived from
ActiveRecord::Base. Active Record allows you to present the data from
database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic
methods.
Although most Rails models are backed by a database, models can also be ordinary
Ruby classes, or Ruby classes that implement a set of interfaces as provided by
the Active Model module.
Controller layer
The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and
providing a suitable response. Usually this means returning HTML, but Rails controllers
can also generate XML, JSON, PDFs, mobile-specific views, and more. Controllers load and
manipulate models, and render view templates in order to generate the appropriate HTTP response.
In Rails, incoming requests are routed by Action Dispatch to an appropriate controller, and
controller classes are derived from ActionController::Base. Action Dispatch and Action Controller
are bundled together in Action Pack.
View layer
The View layer is composed of ""templates"" that are responsible for providing
appropriate representations of your application's resources. Templates can
come in a variety of formats, but most view templates are HTML with embedded
Ruby code (ERB files). Views are typically rendered to generate a controller response,
or to generate the body of an email. In Rails, View generation is handled by Action View.
Frameworks and libraries
Active Record, Active Model, Action Pack, and Action View can each be used independently outside Rails.
In addition to that, Rails also comes with Action Mailer, a library
to generate and send emails; Action Mailbox, a library to receive emails within a Rails application;
Active Job, a framework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queuing
backends; Action Cable, a framework to
integrate WebSockets with a Rails application; Active Storage, a library to attach cloud
and local files to Rails applications; Action Text, a library to handle rich text content;
and Active Support, a collection
of utility classes and standard library extensions that are useful for Rails,
and may also be used independently outside Rails.
Getting Started


Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:
 $ gem install rails



At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:
 $ rails new myapp

where ""myapp"" is the application name.


Change directory to myapp and start the web server:
 $ cd myapp
 $ rails server

Run with --help or -h for options.


Go to http://localhost:3000 and you'll see:
""Yay! You’re on Rails!""


Follow the guidelines to start developing your application. You may find
the following resources handy:

HTML5 Boilerplate


HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building
fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.
This project is the product of years of iterative development and
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.

Homepage: https://html5boilerplate.com/
Source: https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate
Twitter: @h5bp

Quick start
Choose one of the following options:

Download the latest stable release from
html5boilerplate.com.
Clone the git repo — git clone https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate.git - and checkout the
tagged release
you'd like to use.
Install with npm: npm install html5-boilerplate and pull in what you need from the resulting node_modules/html5-boilerplate/dist
Install with yarn: yarn add html5-boilerplate

Features

HTML5 ready. Use the new elements with confidence.
Designed with progressive enhancement in mind.
Includes:

Normalize.css
for CSS normalizations and common bug fixes
jQuery via CDN with SRI Hash and a local fallback
A custom build of Modernizr for feature
detection
Apache Server Configs
that, among other, improve the web site's performance and security


Placeholder CSS Media Queries.
Useful CSS helper classes.
Default print styles, performance optimized.
An optimized version of the Google Universal Analytics snippet.
Protection against any stray console statements causing JavaScript
errors in older browsers.
""Delete-key friendly."" Easy to strip out parts you don't need.
Extensive inline and accompanying documentation.

Browser support

Chrome (latest 2)
Edge (latest 2)
Firefox (latest 2)
Internet Explorer 11
Opera (latest 2)
Safari (latest 2)

This doesn't mean that HTML5 Boilerplate cannot be used in older browsers,
just that we'll ensure compatibility with the ones mentioned above.
If you need legacy browser support you can use HTML5 Boilerplate v6 (IE9/IE10)
or HTML5 Boilerplate v5 (IE 8). They are no longer actively developed.
Documentation
Take a look at the documentation table of contents.
This documentation is bundled with the project which makes it
available for offline reading and provides a useful starting point for
any documentation you want to write about your project.
Contributing
Hundreds of developers have helped to make the HTML5 Boilerplate. Anyone is welcome to contribute,
however, if you decide to get involved, please take a moment to review

Building Lantern
Prerequisites

Custom fork of Go is
currently required. We'll eventually switch to Go 1.7 which supports what we
need due to this.
An OSX or Linux host. Building on Windows is only partially supported with
the help of Cygwin.
Git - brew install git, apt-get install git, etc
GNU Make
Nodejs & NPM
GNU C Library (linux only) - apt-get install libc6-dev-i386, etc
Gulp - npm i gulp-cli -g

To build and run Lantern desktop, just do:
git clone https://github.com/getlantern/lantern.git
cd lantern
make lantern
./lantern
During development, you'll likely want to do a clean build like this:
make clean-desktop lantern && ./lantern
Building Mobile
Mobile Prerequisites
Building the mobile library and app requires the following:

Install Java JDK 7 or 8
Install Go 1.6 or higher
Install Android SDK Tools
Install NDK
Install Gradle

Make sure to set these environment variables before trying to build any Android
components (replace the paths based on wherever you've installed the Android
SDK and NDK).
export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20130917/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools:$PATH
export NDK_HOME=/opt/android-ndk-r10e
export PATH=$NDK_HOME:$PATH
Go Android Library
The core Lantern functionality can be packaged into a native Android library
with:
make android-lib

Java Android SDK
The Java-based Android SDK allows easy embedding of Lantern functionality in 3rd
party Android apps such as Manoto TV. The SDK can be built with:
make android-sdk

Lantern Mobile Testbed
This simple Android application provides a way to test the Android SDK. It can
be built with:
make android-testbed

Lantern Mobile App
Debug
To create a debug build of the full lantern mobile app:
make android-debug

To install on the default device:
make android-install

Release
To create a release build, add the following to your
~/.gradle/gradle.properties file:
KEYSTORE_PWD=$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
KEYSTORE_FILE=keystore.release.jks
KEY_PWD=$KEY_PASSWORD

You can find the exact values to add to your gradle.properties
here.
Then it can be built with:
SECRETS_DIR=$PATH_TO_TOO_MANY_SECRETS \
VERSION=2.0.0-beta1 make android-release
Android Tips
Android Studio
To get the build working for Android Studio, you'll want to add the following
dummy values to your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties file:
lanternRevisionDate=""April 26, 2016""
lanternVersion=2.2.1

Uninstall for All Users
If you use adb to install and debug an app to your Android device during
development and then subsequently build a signed APK and try to install it on
that same device, you may receive an unhelpful error saying ""App Not Installed"".
This typically means that you tried to install the same app but signed with a
different key.  The solution is to uninstall the app first, but you have to
uninstall it for all users. You can do this by selecting ""Uninstall for all
users"" from:
Settings -> Apps -> [Pick the App] -> Hamburger Menu (...) -> Uninstall for all users.

If you forget to do this and just uninstall normally, you'll still encounter the
error. To fix this, you'll have to run the app with adb again and then
uninstall for all users.
Getting HTTP Connections to Use Proxy
In android, programmatic access to HTTP resources typically uses the
HttpURLConnection class.  You can tell it to use a proxy by setting some
system properties:
System.setProperty(""http.proxyHost"", host);
System.setProperty(""http.proxyPort"", port);
System.setProperty(""https.proxyHost"", host);
System.setProperty(""https.proxyPort"", port);
You can disable proxying by clearing those properties:
System.clearProperty(""http.proxyHost"");
System.clearProperty(""http.proxyPort"");
System.clearProperty(""https.proxyHost"");
System.clearProperty(""https.proxyPort"");
However, there is one big caveat - HttpURLConnection uses keep-alives to
reuse existing TCP connections. These TCP connections will still be using the
old proxy settings. This has several implications:
Set the proxy settings as early in the application's lifecycle as possible,
ideally before any HttpURLConnections have been opened.
Don't expect the settings to take effect immediately if some
HttpURLConnections have already been opened.
Disable keep-alives if you need to, which you can do like this:
HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
// Need to force closing so that old connections (with old proxy settings) don't get reused.
urlConnection.setRequestProperty(""Connection"", ""close"");
Building Lantern for running on a server
To run Lantern on a server, you simply need to set a flag to build it in headless mode and then tell it to run on any local address as opposed to binding to localhost (so that it's accessible from other machines). You can do this as follows:

HEADLESS=true make docker-linux or, if you're already running on Linux just HEADLESS=true make linux
./lantern_linux_amd64 --addr 0.0.0.0:8787 or ./lantern_linux_386 --addr 0.0.0.0:8787

Other
Generating assets
make genassets
If the environment variable UPDATE_DIST=true is set, make genassets also
updates the resources in the dist folder.
An annotated tag can be added like this:
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m""Tagged 1.0.0""
git push --tags
Use make create-tag as a shortcut for creating and uploading tags:
VERSION='2.0.0-beta5' make create-tag

If you want to both create a package and upload a tag, run the create-tag task
right after the packages task:
[...env variables...] make packages create-tag

Updating Icons
The icons used for the system tray are stored in
src/github/getlantern/lantern/icons. To apply changes to the icons, make
your updates in the icons folder and then run make update-icons.
Continuous Integration with Travis CI
Continuous builds are run on Travis CI. These builds use the .travis.yml
configuration.  The github.com/getlantern/cf unit tests require an envvars.bash
to be populated with credentials for cloudflare. The original envvars.bash is
available
here.
An encrypted version is checked in as envvars.bash.enc, which was encrypted
per the instructions here.
Documentation for developers
Dev README
Please, go to README-dev for an in-depth explanation of the Lantern internals and cloud services.
Release README
Please visit README-release for details on building release versions of Lantern.
Translations README
More info for dealing with translations is available in README-translations.
Contributing changes
Lantern is a gost project that
provides repeatable builds and consolidated pull requests for lantern.
Go code in Lantern must pass several tests:

errcheck
golint
Go vet
Go test -race

You can find a generic git-hook
file, which can be used as a pre-push (or pre-commit) hook to automatically
ensure these tests are passed before committing any code. Only Go packages in
src/github.com/getlantern will be tested, and only those that have changes in
them.
Install by copying it into the local .git/hooks/ directory, with the pre-push
file name if you want to run it before pushing. Alternatively, you can copy
pre-commit.hook
to pre-commit to run it before each commit.
ln -s ""$(pwd)/prehook.sh"" .git/hooks/prehook.sh
ln -s ""$(pwd)/pre-push"" .git/hooks/pre-push
Important notice
If you must commit without running the hooks, you can run git with the
--no-verify flag.

HTTPie: a CLI, cURL-like tool for humans
HTTPie (pronounced aitch-tee-tee-pie) is a command line HTTP client.
Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly
as possible. It provides a simple http command that allows for sending
arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and natural syntax, and displays
colorized output. HTTPie can be used for testing, debugging, and
generally interacting with HTTP servers.

2   Installation

2.1   macOS
On macOS, HTTPie can be installed via Homebrew
(recommended):
$ brew install httpie
A MacPorts port is also available:
$ port install httpie

2.2   Linux
Most Linux distributions provide a package that can be installed using the
system package manager, for example:
# Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
$ apt-get install httpie
# Fedora
$ dnf install httpie
# CentOS, RHEL, ...
$ yum install httpie
# Arch Linux
$ pacman -S httpie

2.3   Windows, etc.
A universal installation method (that works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, …,
and always provides the latest version) is to use pip:
# Make sure we have an up-to-date version of pip and setuptools:
$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

$ pip install --upgrade httpie
(If pip installation fails for some reason, you can try
easy_install httpie as a fallback.)

2.4   Python version
Although Python 2.7 is supported as well, it is strongly recommended to
install HTTPie against the latest Python 3.x whenever possible. That will
ensure that some of the newer HTTP features, such as
SNI (Server Name Indication), work out of the box.
Python 3 is the default for Homebrew installations starting with version 0.9.4.
To see which version HTTPie uses, run http --debug.

2.5   Unstable version
You can also install the latest unreleased development version directly from
the master branch on GitHub.  It is a work-in-progress of a future stable
release so the experience might be not as smooth.

On macOS you can install it with Homebrew:
$ brew install httpie --HEAD
Otherwise with pip:
$ pip install --upgrade https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie/archive/master.tar.gz
Verify that now we have the
current development version identifier
with the -dev suffix, for example:
$ http --version
1.0.0-dev

3   Usage
Hello World:
$ http httpie.org
Synopsis:
$ http [flags] [METHOD] URL [ITEM [ITEM]]
See also http --help.

3.1   Examples
Custom HTTP method, HTTP headers and JSON data:
$ http PUT example.org X-API-Token:123 name=John
Submitting forms:
$ http -f POST example.org hello=World
See the request that is being sent using one of the output options:
$ http -v example.org
Use Github API to post a comment on an
issue
with authentication:
$ http -a USERNAME POST https://api.github.com/repos/jakubroztocil/httpie/issues/83/comments body='HTTPie is awesome! :heart:'
Upload a file using redirected input:
$ http example.org < file.json
Download a file and save it via redirected output:
$ http example.org/file > file
Download a file wget style:
$ http --download example.org/file
Use named sessions to make certain aspects or the communication persistent
between requests to the same host:
$ http --session=logged-in -a username:password httpbin.org/get API-Key:123

$ http --session=logged-in httpbin.org/headers
Set a custom Host header to work around missing DNS records:
$ http localhost:8000 Host:example.com

4   HTTP method
The name of the HTTP method comes right before the URL argument:
$ http DELETE example.org/todos/7
Which looks similar to the actual Request-Line that is sent:
DELETE /todos/7 HTTP/1.1
When the METHOD argument is omitted from the command, HTTPie defaults to
either GET (with no request data) or POST (with request data).

5   Request URL
The only information HTTPie needs to perform a request is a URL.
The default scheme is, somewhat unsurprisingly, http://,
and can be omitted from the argument – http example.org works just fine.

5.1   Querystring parameters
If you find yourself manually constructing URLs with querystring parameters
on the terminal, you may appreciate the param==value syntax for appending
URL parameters. With that, you don't have to worry about escaping the &
separators for your shell. Also, special characters in parameter values,
will also automatically escaped (HTTPie otherwise expects the URL to be
already escaped). To search for HTTPie logo on Google Images you could use
this command:
$ http www.google.com search=='HTTPie logo' tbm==isch
GET /?search=HTTPie+logo&tbm=isch HTTP/1.1

5.2   URL shortcuts for localhost
Additionally, curl-like shorthand for localhost is supported.
This means that, for example :3000 would expand to http://localhost:3000
If the port is omitted, then port 80 is assumed.
$ http :/foo
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
$ http :3000/bar
GET /bar HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
$ http :
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

5.3   Custom default scheme
You can use the --default-scheme <URL_SCHEME> option to create
shortcuts for other protocols than HTTP:
$ alias https='http --default-scheme=https'

6   Request items
There are a few different request item types that provide a
convenient mechanism for specifying HTTP headers, simple JSON and
form data, files, and URL parameters.
They are key/value pairs specified after the URL. All have in
common that they become part of the actual request that is sent and that
their type is distinguished only by the separator used:
:, =, :=, ==, @, =@, and :=@. The ones with an
@ expect a file path as value.


Item Type
Description



HTTP Headers
Name:Value
Arbitrary HTTP header, e.g. X-API-Token:123.

URL parameters
name==value
Appends the given name/value pair as a query
string parameter to the URL.
The == separator is used.

Data Fields
field=value,
field=@file.txt
Request data fields to be serialized as a JSON
object (default), or to be form-encoded
(--form, -f).

Raw JSON fields
field:=json,
field:=@file.json
Useful when sending JSON and one or
more fields need to be a Boolean, Number,
nested Object, or an Array,  e.g.,
meals:='[""ham"",""spam""]' or pies:=[1,2,3]
(note the quotes).

Form File Fields
field@/dir/file
Only available with --form, -f.
For example screenshot@~/Pictures/img.png.
The presence of a file field results
in a multipart/form-data request.



Note that data fields aren't the only way to specify request data:
Redirected input is a mechanism for passing arbitrary request data.

6.1   Escaping rules
You can use \ to escape characters that shouldn't be used as separators
(or parts thereof). For instance, foo\==bar will become a data key/value
pair (foo= and bar) instead of a URL parameter.
Often it is necessary to quote the values, e.g. foo='bar baz'.
If any of the field names or headers starts with a minus
(e.g., -fieldname), you need to place all such items after the special
token -- to prevent confusion with --arguments:
$ http httpbin.org/post  --  -name-starting-with-dash=foo -Unusual-Header:bar
POST /post HTTP/1.1
-Unusual-Header: bar
Content-Type: application/json

{
    ""-name-starting-with-dash"": ""foo""
}

7   JSON
JSON is the lingua franca of modern web services and it is also the
implicit content type HTTPie uses by default.
Simple example:
$ http PUT example.org name=John email=john@example.org
PUT / HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/json
Host: example.org

{
    ""name"": ""John"",
    ""email"": ""john@example.org""
}

7.1   Default behaviour
If your command includes some data request items, they are serialized as a JSON
object by default. HTTPie also automatically sets the following headers,
both of which can be overwritten:


Content-Type
application/json

Accept
application/json, */*




7.2   Explicit JSON
You can use --json, -j to explicitly set Accept
to application/json regardless of whether you are sending data
(it's a shortcut for setting the header via the usual header notation:
http url Accept:'application/json, */*'). Additionally,
HTTPie will try to detect JSON responses even when the
Content-Type is incorrectly text/plain or unknown.

7.3   Non-string JSON fields
Non-string fields use the := separator, which allows you to embed raw JSON
into the resulting object. Text and raw JSON files can also be embedded into
fields using =@ and :=@:
$ http PUT api.example.com/person/1 \
    name=John \
    age:=29 married:=false hobbies:='[""http"", ""pies""]' \  # Raw JSON
    description=@about-john.txt \   # Embed text file
    bookmarks:=@bookmarks.json      # Embed JSON file
PUT /person/1 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, */*
Content-Type: application/json
Host: api.example.com

{
    ""age"": 29,
    ""hobbies"": [
        ""http"",
        ""pies""
    ],
    ""description"": ""John is a nice guy who likes pies."",
    ""married"": false,
    ""name"": ""John"",
    ""bookmarks"": {
        ""HTTPie"": ""http://httpie.org"",
    }
}
Please note that with this syntax the command gets unwieldy when sending
complex data. In that case it's always better to use redirected input:
$ http POST api.example.com/person/1 < person.json

8   Forms
Submitting forms is very similar to sending JSON requests. Often the only
difference is in adding the --form, -f option, which ensures that
data fields are serialized as, and Content-Type is set to,
application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8. It is possible to make
form data the implicit content type instead of JSON
via the config file.

8.1   Regular forms
$ http --form POST api.example.org/person/1 name='John Smith'
POST /person/1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8

name=John+Smith

8.2   File upload forms
If one or more file fields is present, the serialization and content type is
multipart/form-data:
$ http -f POST example.com/jobs name='John Smith' cv@~/Documents/cv.pdf
The request above is the same as if the following HTML form were
submitted:
<form enctype=""multipart/form-data"" method=""post"" action=""http://example.com/jobs"">
    <input type=""text"" name=""name"" />
    <input type=""file"" name=""cv"" />
</form>
Note that @ is used to simulate a file upload form field, whereas
=@ just embeds the file content as a regular text field value.

9   HTTP headers
To set custom headers you can use the Header:Value notation:
$ http example.org  User-Agent:Bacon/1.0  'Cookie:valued-visitor=yes;foo=bar'  \
    X-Foo:Bar  Referer:http://httpie.org/
GET / HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: valued-visitor=yes;foo=bar
Host: example.org
Referer: http://httpie.org/
User-Agent: Bacon/1.0
X-Foo: Bar

9.1   Default request headers
There are a couple of default headers that HTTPie sets:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: HTTPie/<version>
Host: <taken-from-URL>
Any of these except Host can be overwritten and some of them unset.

9.2   Empty headers and header un-setting
To unset a previously specified header
(such a one of the default headers), use Header::
$ http httpbin.org/headers Accept: User-Agent:
To send a header with an empty value, use Header;:
$ http httpbin.org/headers 'Header;'

10   Cookies
HTTP clients send cookies to the server as regular HTTP headers. That means,
HTTPie does not offer any special syntax for specifying cookies — the usual
Header:Value notation is used:
Send a single cookie:
$ http example.org Cookie:sessionid=foo
GET / HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: sessionid=foo
Host: example.org
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.9.9
Send multiple cookies
(note the header is quoted to prevent the shell from interpreting the ;):
$ http example.org 'Cookie:sessionid=foo;another-cookie=bar'
GET / HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: sessionid=foo;another-cookie=bar
Host: example.org
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.9.9
If you often deal with cookies in your requests, then chances are you'd appreciate
the sessions feature.

11   Authentication
The currently supported authentication schemes are Basic and Digest
(see auth plugins for more). There are two flags that control authentication:


--auth, -a
Pass a username:password pair as
the argument. Or, if you only specify a username
(-a username), you'll be prompted for
the password before the request is sent.
To send an empty password, pass username:.
The username:password@hostname URL syntax is
supported as well (but credentials passed via -a
have higher priority).

--auth-type, -A
Specify the auth mechanism. Possible values are
basic and digest. The default value is
basic so it can often be omitted.




11.1   Basic auth
$ http -a username:password example.org

11.2   Digest auth
$ http -A digest -a username:password example.org

11.3   Password prompt
$ http -a username example.org

11.4   .netrc
Authentication information from your ~/.netrc file is honored as well:
$ cat ~/.netrc
machine httpbin.org
login httpie
password test

$ http httpbin.org/basic-auth/httpie/test
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]

11.5   Auth plugins
Additional authentication mechanism can be installed as plugins.
They can be found on the Python Package Index.
Here's a few picks:

httpie-api-auth: ApiAuth
httpie-aws-auth: AWS / Amazon S3
httpie-edgegrid: EdgeGrid
httpie-hmac-auth: HMAC
httpie-jwt-auth: JWTAuth (JSON Web Tokens)
httpie-negotiate: SPNEGO (GSS Negotiate)
httpie-ntlm: NTLM (NT LAN Manager)
httpie-oauth: OAuth
requests-hawk: Hawk


12   HTTP redirects
By default, HTTP redirects are not followed and only the first
response is shown:
$ http httpbin.org/redirect/3

12.1   Follow Location
To instruct HTTPie to follow the Location header of 30x responses
and show the final response instead, use the --follow, -F option:
$ http --follow httpbin.org/redirect/3

12.2   Showing intermediary redirect responses
If you additionally wish to see the intermediary requests/responses,
then use the --all option as well:
$ http --follow --all httpbin.org/redirect/3

12.3   Limiting maximum redirects followed
To change the default limit of maximum 30 redirects, use the
--max-redirects=<limit> option:
$ http --follow --all --max-redirects=5 httpbin.org/redirect/3

13   Proxies
You can specify proxies to be used through the --proxy argument for each
protocol (which is included in the value in case of redirects across protocols):
$ http --proxy=http:http://10.10.1.10:3128 --proxy=https:https://10.10.1.10:1080 example.org
With Basic authentication:
$ http --proxy=http:http://user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128 example.org

13.1   Environment variables
You can also configure proxies by environment variables HTTP_PROXY and
HTTPS_PROXY, and the underlying Requests library will pick them up as well.
If you want to disable proxies configured through the environment variables for
certain hosts, you can specify them in NO_PROXY.
In your ~/.bash_profile:
export HTTP_PROXY=http://10.10.1.10:3128
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://10.10.1.10:1080
export NO_PROXY=localhost,example.com

13.2   SOCKS
Homebrew-installed HTTPie comes with SOCKS proxy support out of the box. To enable SOCKS proxy support for non-Homebrew  installations, you'll need to install requests[socks] manually using pip:
$ pip install -U requests[socks]
Usage is the same as for other types of proxies:
$ http --proxy=http:socks5://user:pass@host:port --proxy=https:socks5://user:pass@host:port example.org

14   HTTPS

14.1   Server SSL certificate verification
To skip the host's SSL certificate verification, you can pass --verify=no
(default is yes):
$ http --verify=no https://example.org

14.2   Custom CA bundle
You can also use --verify=<CA_BUNDLE_PATH> to set a custom CA bundle path:
$ http --verify=/ssl/custom_ca_bundle https://example.org

14.3   Client side SSL certificate
To use a client side certificate for the SSL communication, you can pass
the path of the cert file with --cert:
$ http --cert=client.pem https://example.org
If the private key is not contained in the cert file you may pass the
path of the key file with --cert-key:
$ http --cert=client.crt --cert-key=client.key https://example.org

14.4   SSL version
Use the --ssl=<PROTOCOL> to specify the desired protocol version to use.
This will default to SSL v2.3 which will negotiate the highest protocol that both
the server and your installation of OpenSSL support. The available protocols
are ssl2.3, ssl3, tls1, tls1.1, tls1.2, tls1.3. (The actually
available set of protocols may vary depending on your OpenSSL installation.)
# Specify the vulnerable SSL v3 protocol to talk to an outdated server:
$ http --ssl=ssl3 https://vulnerable.example.org

14.5   SNI (Server Name Indication)
If you use HTTPie with Python version lower than 2.7.9
(can be verified with http --debug) and need to talk to servers that
use SNI (Server Name Indication) you need to install some additional
dependencies:
$ pip install --upgrade requests[security]
You can use the following command to test SNI support:
$ http https://sni.velox.ch

15   Output options
By default, HTTPie only outputs the final response and the whole response
message is printed (headers as well as the body). You can control what should
be printed via several options:


--headers, -h
Only the response headers are printed.

--body, -b
Only the response body is printed.

--verbose, -v
Print the whole HTTP exchange (request and response).
This option also enables --all (see below).

--print, -p
Selects parts of the HTTP exchange.



--verbose can often be useful for debugging the request and generating
documentation examples:
$ http --verbose PUT httpbin.org/put hello=world
PUT /put HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/json
Host: httpbin.org
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.2.7dev

{
    ""hello"": ""world""
}


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 477
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Sun, 05 Aug 2012 00:25:23 GMT
Server: gunicorn/0.13.4

{
    […]
}

15.1   What parts of the HTTP exchange should be printed
All the other output options are under the hood just shortcuts for
the more powerful --print, -p. It accepts a string of characters each
of which represents a specific part of the HTTP exchange:


Character
Stands for



H
request headers

B
request body

h
response headers

b
response body



Print request and response headers:
$ http --print=Hh PUT httpbin.org/put hello=world

15.2   Viewing intermediary requests/responses
To see all the HTTP communication, i.e. the final request/response as
well as any possible  intermediary requests/responses, use the --all
option. The intermediary HTTP communication include followed redirects
(with --follow), the first unauthorized request when HTTP digest
authentication is used (--auth=digest), etc.
# Include all responses that lead to the final one:
$ http --all --follow httpbin.org/redirect/3
The intermediary requests/response are by default formatted according to
--print, -p (and its shortcuts described above). If you'd like to change
that, use the --history-print, -P option. It takes the same
arguments as --print, -p but applies to the intermediary requests only.
# Print the intermediary requests/responses differently than the final one:
$ http -A digest -a foo:bar --all -p Hh -P H httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/foo/bar

15.3   Conditional body download
As an optimization, the response body is downloaded from the server
only if it's part of the output. This is similar to performing a HEAD
request, except that it applies to any HTTP method you use.
Let's say that there is an API that returns the whole resource when it is
updated, but you are only interested in the response headers to see the
status code after an update:
$ http --headers PATCH example.org/Really-Huge-Resource name='New Name'
Since we are only printing the HTTP headers here, the connection to the server
is closed as soon as all the response headers have been received.
Therefore, bandwidth and time isn't wasted downloading the body
which you don't care about. The response headers are downloaded always,
even if they are not part of the output

16   Redirected Input
The universal method for passing request data is through redirected stdin
(standard input)—piping. Such data is buffered and then with no further
processing used as the request body. There are multiple useful ways to use
piping:
Redirect from a file:
$ http PUT example.com/person/1 X-API-Token:123 < person.json
Or the output of another program:
$ grep '401 Unauthorized' /var/log/httpd/error_log | http POST example.org/intruders
You can use echo for simple data:
$ echo '{""name"": ""John""}' | http PATCH example.com/person/1 X-API-Token:123
You can also use a Bash here string:
$ http example.com/ <<<'{""name"": ""John""}'
You can even pipe web services together using HTTPie:
$ http GET https://api.github.com/repos/jakubroztocil/httpie | http POST httpbin.org/post
You can use cat to enter multiline data on the terminal:
$ cat | http POST example.com
<paste>
^D
$ cat | http POST example.com/todos Content-Type:text/plain
- buy milk
- call parents
^D
On OS X, you can send the contents of the clipboard with pbpaste:
$ pbpaste | http PUT example.com
Passing data through stdin cannot be combined with data fields specified
on the command line:
$ echo 'data' | http POST example.org more=data   # This is invalid
To prevent HTTPie from reading stdin data you can use the
--ignore-stdin option.

16.1   Request data from a filename
An alternative to redirected stdin is specifying a filename (as
@/path/to/file) whose content is used as if it came from stdin.
It has the advantage that the Content-Type
header is automatically set to the appropriate value based on the
filename extension. For example, the following request sends the
verbatim contents of that XML file with Content-Type: application/xml:
$ http PUT httpbin.org/put @/data/file.xml

17   Terminal output
HTTPie does several things by default in order to make its terminal output
easy to read.

17.1   Colors and formatting
Syntax highlighting is applied to HTTP headers and bodies (where it makes
sense). You can choose your preferred color scheme via the --style option
if you don't like the default one (see $ http --help for the possible
values).
Also, the following formatting is applied:

HTTP headers are sorted by name.
JSON data is indented, sorted by keys, and unicode escapes are converted
to the characters they represent.

One of these options can be used to control output processing:


--pretty=all
Apply both colors and formatting.
Default for terminal output.

--pretty=colors
Apply colors.

--pretty=format
Apply formatting.

--pretty=none
Disables output processing.
Default for redirected output.




17.2   Binary data
Binary data is suppressed for terminal output, which makes it safe to perform
requests to URLs that send back binary data. Binary data is suppressed also in
redirected, but prettified output. The connection is closed as soon as we know
that the response body is binary,
$ http example.org/Movie.mov
You will nearly instantly see something like this:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: video/quicktime
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

+-----------------------------------------+
| NOTE: binary data not shown in terminal |
+-----------------------------------------+

18   Redirected output
HTTPie uses a different set of defaults for redirected output than for
terminal output. The differences being:

Formatting and colors aren't applied (unless --pretty is specified).
Only the response body is printed (unless one of the output options is set).
Also, binary data isn't suppressed.

The reason is to make piping HTTPie's output to another programs and
downloading files work with no extra flags. Most of the time, only the raw
response body is of an interest when the output is redirected.
Download a file:
$ http example.org/Movie.mov > Movie.mov
Download an image of Octocat, resize it using ImageMagick, upload it elsewhere:
$ http octodex.github.com/images/original.jpg | convert - -resize 25% -  | http example.org/Octocats
Force colorizing and formatting, and show both the request and the response in
less pager:
$ http --pretty=all --verbose example.org | less -R
The -R flag tells less to interpret color escape sequences included
HTTPie`s output.
You can create a shortcut for invoking HTTPie with colorized and paged output
by adding the following to your ~/.bash_profile:
function httpless {
    # `httpless example.org'
    http --pretty=all --print=hb ""$@"" | less -R;
}

19   Download mode
HTTPie features a download mode in which it acts similarly to wget.
When enabled using the --download, -d flag, response headers are printed to
the terminal (stderr), and a progress bar is shown while the response body
is being saved to a file.
$ http --download https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie/archive/master.tar.gz
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=httpie-master.tar.gz
Content-Length: 257336
Content-Type: application/x-gzip

Downloading 251.30 kB to ""httpie-master.tar.gz""
Done. 251.30 kB in 2.73862s (91.76 kB/s)

19.1   Downloaded file name
If not provided via --output, -o, the output filename will be determined
from Content-Disposition (if available), or from the URL and
Content-Type. If the guessed filename already exists, HTTPie adds a unique
suffix to it.

19.2   Piping while downloading
You can also redirect the response body to another program while the response
headers and progress are still shown in the terminal:
$ http -d https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie/archive/master.tar.gz |  tar zxf -

19.3   Resuming downloads
If --output, -o is specified, you can resume a partial download using the
--continue, -c option. This only works with servers that support
Range requests and 206 Partial Content responses. If the server doesn't
support that, the whole file will simply be downloaded:
$ http -dco file.zip example.org/file

19.4   Other notes

The --download option only changes how the response body is treated.
You can still set custom headers, use sessions, --verbose, -v, etc.
--download always implies --follow (redirects are followed).
HTTPie exits with status code 1 (error) if the body hasn't been fully
downloaded.
Accept-Encoding cannot be set with --download.


20   Streamed responses
Responses are downloaded and printed in chunks which allows for streaming
and large file downloads without using too much memory. However, when
colors and formatting is applied, the whole response is buffered and only
then processed at once.

20.1   Disabling buffering
You can use the --stream, -S flag to make two things happen:

The output is flushed in much smaller chunks without any buffering,
which makes HTTPie behave kind of like tail -f for URLs.
Streaming becomes enabled even when the output is prettified: It will be
applied to each line of the response and flushed immediately. This makes
it possible to have a nice output for long-lived requests, such as one
to the Twitter streaming API.


20.2   Examples use cases
Prettified streamed response:
$ http --stream -f -a YOUR-TWITTER-NAME https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json track='Justin Bieber'
Streamed output by small chunks alá tail -f:
# Send each new tweet (JSON object) mentioning ""Apple"" to another
# server as soon as it arrives from the Twitter streaming API:
$ http --stream -f -a YOUR-TWITTER-NAME https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json track=Apple \
| while read tweet; do echo ""$tweet"" | http POST example.org/tweets ; done

21   Sessions
By default, every request HTTPie makes is completely independent of any
previous ones to the same host.
However, HTTPie also supports persistent
sessions via the --session=SESSION_NAME_OR_PATH option. In a session,
custom HTTP headers (except for the ones starting with Content- or If-),
authentication, and cookies
(manually specified or sent by the server) persist between requests
to the same host.
# Create a new session
$ http --session=/tmp/session.json example.org API-Token:123

# Re-use an existing session — API-Token will be set:
$ http --session=/tmp/session.json example.org
All session data, including credentials, cookie data,
and custom headers are stored in plain text.
That means session files can also be created and edited manually in a text
editor—they are regular JSON. It also means that they can be read by anyone
who has access to the session file.

21.1   Named sessions
You can create one or more named session per host. For example, this is how
you can create a new session named user1 for example.org:
$ http --session=user1 -a user1:password example.org X-Foo:Bar
From now on, you can refer to the session by its name. When you choose to
use the session again, any previously specified authentication or HTTP headers
will automatically be set:
$ http --session=user1 example.org
To create or reuse a different session, simple specify a different name:
$ http --session=user2 -a user2:password example.org X-Bar:Foo
Named sessions' data is stored in JSON files in the directory
~/.httpie/sessions/<host>/<name>.json
(%APPDATA%\httpie\sessions\<host>\<name>.json on Windows).

21.2   Anonymous sessions
Instead of a name, you can also directly specify a path to a session file. This
allows for sessions to be re-used across multiple hosts:
$ http --session=/tmp/session.json example.org
$ http --session=/tmp/session.json admin.example.org
$ http --session=~/.httpie/sessions/another.example.org/test.json example.org
$ http --session-read-only=/tmp/session.json example.org

21.3   Readonly session
To use an existing session file without updating it from the request/response
exchange once it is created, specify the session name via
--session-read-only=SESSION_NAME_OR_PATH instead.

22   Config
HTTPie uses a simple JSON config file.

22.1   Config file location
The default location of the configuration file is ~/.httpie/config.json
(or %APPDATA%\httpie\config.json on Windows). The config directory
location can be changed by setting the HTTPIE_CONFIG_DIR
environment variable. To view the exact location run http --debug.

22.2   Configurable options
The JSON file contains an object with the following keys:

22.2.1   default_options
An Array (by default empty) of default options that should be applied to
every invocation of HTTPie.
For instance, you can use this option to change the default style and output
options: ""default_options"": [""--style=fruity"", ""--body""] Another useful
default option could be ""--session=default"" to make HTTPie always
use sessions (one named default will automatically be used).
Or you could change the implicit request content type from JSON to form by
adding --form to the list.

22.2.2   __meta__
HTTPie automatically stores some of its metadata here. Please do not change.

22.3   Un-setting previously specified options
Default options from the config file, or specified any other way,
can be unset for a particular invocation via --no-OPTION arguments passed
on the command line (e.g., --no-style or --no-session).

23   Scripting
When using HTTPie from shell scripts, it can be handy to set the
--check-status flag. It instructs HTTPie to exit with an error if the
HTTP status is one of 3xx, 4xx, or 5xx. The exit status will
be 3 (unless --follow is set), 4, or 5,
respectively.
#!/bin/bash

if http --check-status --ignore-stdin --timeout=2.5 HEAD example.org/health &> /dev/null; then
    echo 'OK!'
else
    case $? in
        2) echo 'Request timed out!' ;;
        3) echo 'Unexpected HTTP 3xx Redirection!' ;;
        4) echo 'HTTP 4xx Client Error!' ;;
        5) echo 'HTTP 5xx Server Error!' ;;
        6) echo 'Exceeded --max-redirects=<n> redirects!' ;;
        *) echo 'Other Error!' ;;
    esac
fi

23.1   Best practices
The default behaviour of automatically reading stdin is typically not
desirable during non-interactive invocations. You most likely want to
use the --ignore-stdin option to disable it.
It is a common gotcha that without this option HTTPie seemingly hangs.
What happens is that when HTTPie is invoked for example from a cron job,
stdin is not connected to a terminal.
Therefore, rules for redirected input apply, i.e., HTTPie starts to read it
expecting that the request body will be passed through.
And since there's no data nor EOF, it will be stuck. So unless you're
piping some data to HTTPie, this flag should be used in scripts.
Also, it might be good to override the default 30 second --timeout to
something that suits you.

24   Meta

24.1   Interface design
The syntax of the command arguments closely corresponds to the actual HTTP
requests sent over the wire. It has the advantage  that it's easy to remember
and read. It is often possible to translate an HTTP request to an HTTPie
argument list just by inlining the request elements. For example, compare this
HTTP request:
POST /collection HTTP/1.1
X-API-Key: 123
User-Agent: Bacon/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=value&name2=value2
with the HTTPie command that sends it:
$ http -f POST example.org/collection \
  X-API-Key:123 \
  User-Agent:Bacon/1.0 \
  name=value \
  name2=value2
Notice that both the order of elements and the syntax is very similar,
and that only a small portion of the command is used to control HTTPie and
doesn't directly correspond to any part of the request (here it's only -f
asking HTTPie to send a form request).
The two modes, --pretty=all (default for terminal) and --pretty=none
(default for redirected output), allow for both user-friendly interactive use
and usage from scripts, where HTTPie serves as a generic HTTP client.
As HTTPie is still under heavy development, the existing command line
syntax and some of the --OPTIONS may change slightly before
HTTPie reaches its final version 1.0. All changes are recorded in the
change log.

Port to ECMAScript 6 (version 2.10.0)
Moment 2.10.0 does not bring any new features, but the code is now written in
ECMAScript 6 modules and placed inside src/. Previously moment.js, locale/*.js and
test/moment/*.js, test/locale/*.js contained the source of the project. Now
the source is in src/, temporary build (ECMAScript 5) files are placed under
build/umd/ (for running tests during development), and the moment.js and
locale/*.js files are updated only on release.
If you want to use a particular revision of the code, make sure to run
grunt transpile update-index, so moment.js and locales/*.js are synced

Upgrading to 2.0.0
There are a number of small backwards incompatible changes with version 2.0.0. See the full descriptions here


Changed language ordinal method to return the number + ordinal instead of just the ordinal.


Changed two digit year parsing cutoff to match strptime.


Removed moment#sod and moment#eod in favor of moment#startOf and moment#endOf.


Removed moment.humanizeDuration() in favor of moment.duration().humanize().


Removed the lang data objects from the top level namespace.

Keras: Deep Learning for humans



You have just found Keras.
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

Read the documentation at Keras.io.
Keras is compatible with: Python 2.7-3.6.

Guiding principles


User friendliness. Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. It puts user experience front and center. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error.


Modularity. A model is understood as a sequence or a graph of standalone, fully configurable modules that can be plugged together with as few restrictions as possible. In particular, neural layers, cost functions, optimizers, initialization schemes, activation functions and regularization schemes are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new models.


Easy extensibility. New modules are simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing modules provide ample examples. To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making Keras suitable for advanced research.


Work with Python. No separate models configuration files in a declarative format. Models are described in Python code, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility.



Getting started: 30 seconds to Keras
The core data structure of Keras is a model, a way to organize layers. The simplest type of model is the Sequential model, a linear stack of layers. For more complex architectures, you should use the Keras functional API, which allows to build arbitrary graphs of layers.
Here is the Sequential model:
from keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential()
Stacking layers is as easy as .add():
from keras.layers import Dense

model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
Once your model looks good, configure its learning process with .compile():
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='sgd',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
If you need to, you can further configure your optimizer. A core principle of Keras is to make things reasonably simple, while allowing the user to be fully in control when they need to (the ultimate control being the easy extensibility of the source code).
model.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,
              optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True))
You can now iterate on your training data in batches:
# x_train and y_train are Numpy arrays --just like in the Scikit-Learn API.
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
Alternatively, you can feed batches to your model manually:
model.train_on_batch(x_batch, y_batch)
Evaluate your performance in one line:
loss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)
Or generate predictions on new data:
classes = model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128)
Building a question answering system, an image classification model, a Neural Turing Machine, or any other model is just as fast. The ideas behind deep learning are simple, so why should their implementation be painful?
For a more in-depth tutorial about Keras, you can check out:

Getting started with the Sequential model
Getting started with the functional API

In the examples folder of the repository, you will find more advanced models: question-answering with memory networks, text generation with stacked LSTMs, etc.

Installation
Before installing Keras, please install one of its backend engines: TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. We recommend the TensorFlow backend.

TensorFlow installation instructions.
Theano installation instructions.
CNTK installation instructions.

You may also consider installing the following optional dependencies:

cuDNN (recommended if you plan on running Keras on GPU).
HDF5 and h5py (required if you plan on saving Keras models to disk).
graphviz and pydot (used by visualization utilities to plot model graphs).

Then, you can install Keras itself. There are two ways to install Keras:

Install Keras from PyPI (recommended):

Note: These installation steps assume that you are on a Linux or Mac environment.
If you are on Windows, you will need to remove sudo to run the commands below.
sudo pip install keras
If you are using a virtualenv, you may want to avoid using sudo:
pip install keras

Alternatively: install Keras from the GitHub source:

First, clone Keras using git:
git clone https://github.com/keras-team/keras.git
Then, cd to the Keras folder and run the install command:
cd keras
sudo python setup.py install

Configuring your Keras backend
By default, Keras will use TensorFlow as its tensor manipulation library. Follow these instructions to configure the Keras backend.

Support
You can ask questions and join the development discussion:

On the Keras Google group.
On the Keras Slack channel. Use this link to request an invitation to the channel.

You can also post bug reports and feature requests (only) in GitHub issues. Make sure to read our guidelines first.

Why this name, Keras?
Keras (κέρας) means horn in Greek. It is a reference to a literary image from ancient Greek and Latin literature, first found in the Odyssey, where dream spirits (Oneiroi, singular Oneiros) are divided between those who deceive men with false visions, who arrive to Earth through a gate of ivory, and those who announce a future that will come to pass, who arrive through a gate of horn. It's a play on the words κέρας (horn) / κραίνω (fulfill), and ἐλέφας (ivory) / ἐλεφαίρομαι (deceive).
Keras was initially developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System).

""Oneiroi are beyond our unravelling --who can be sure what tale they tell? Not all that men look for comes to pass. Two gates there are that give passage to fleeting Oneiroi; one is made of horn, one of ivory. The Oneiroi that pass through sawn ivory are deceitful, bearing a message that will not be fulfilled; those that come out through polished horn have truth behind them, to be accomplished for men who see them."" Homer, Odyssey 19. 562 ff (Shewring translation).

Getting Started
First of all, DON’T PANIC. It will take 5 minutes to get the gist of what Elasticsearch is all about.
Requirements
You need to have a recent version of Java installed. See the Setup page for more information.
Installation

Download and unzip the Elasticsearch official distribution.
Run bin/elasticsearch on unix, or bin\elasticsearch.bat on windows.
Run curl -X GET http://localhost:9200/.
Start more servers …

Indexing
Let’s try and index some twitter like information. First, let’s index some tweets (the twitter index will be created automatically):
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_doc/1?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""user"": ""kimchy"",
    ""post_date"": ""2009-11-15T13:12:00"",
    ""message"": ""Trying out Elasticsearch, so far so good?""
}'

curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_doc/2?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""user"": ""kimchy"",
    ""post_date"": ""2009-11-15T14:12:12"",
    ""message"": ""Another tweet, will it be indexed?""
}'

curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_doc/3?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""user"": ""elastic"",
    ""post_date"": ""2010-01-15T01:46:38"",
    ""message"": ""Building the site, should be kewl""
}'

Now, let’s see if the information was added by GETting it:
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_doc/1?pretty=true'
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_doc/2?pretty=true'
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_doc/3?pretty=true'

Searching
Mmm search…, shouldn’t it be elastic?
Let’s find all the tweets that kimchy posted:
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_search?q=user:kimchy&pretty=true'

We can also use the JSON query language Elasticsearch provides instead of a query string:
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_search?pretty=true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""query"" : {
        ""match"" : { ""user"": ""kimchy"" }
    }
}'

Just for kicks, let’s get all the documents stored (we should see the tweet from elastic as well):
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_search?pretty=true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""query"" : {
        ""match_all"" : {}
    }
}'

We can also do range search (the post_date was automatically identified as date)
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_search?pretty=true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""query"" : {
        ""range"" : {
            ""post_date"" : { ""from"" : ""2009-11-15T13:00:00"", ""to"" : ""2009-11-15T14:00:00"" }
        }
    }
}'

There are many more options to perform search, after all, it’s a search product no? All the familiar Lucene queries are available through the JSON query language, or through the query parser.
Multi Tenant – Indices and Types
Man, that twitter index might get big (in this case, index size == valuation). Let’s see if we can structure our twitter system a bit differently in order to support such large amounts of data.
Elasticsearch supports multiple indices. In the previous example we used an index called twitter that stored tweets for every user.
Another way to define our simple twitter system is to have a different index per user (note, though that each index has an overhead). Here is the indexing curl’s in this case:
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/kimchy/_doc/1?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""user"": ""kimchy"",
    ""post_date"": ""2009-11-15T13:12:00"",
    ""message"": ""Trying out Elasticsearch, so far so good?""
}'

curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/kimchy/_doc/2?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""user"": ""kimchy"",
    ""post_date"": ""2009-11-15T14:12:12"",
    ""message"": ""Another tweet, will it be indexed?""
}'

The above will index information into the kimchy index. Each user will get their own special index.
Complete control on the index level is allowed. As an example, in the above case, we would want to change from the default 5 shards with 1 replica per index, to only 1 shard with 1 replica per index (== per twitter user). Here is how this can be done (the configuration can be in yaml as well):
curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/another_user?pretty -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""index"" : {
        ""number_of_shards"" : 1,
        ""number_of_replicas"" : 1
    }
}'

Search (and similar operations) are multi index aware. This means that we can easily search on more than one
index (twitter user), for example:
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/kimchy,another_user/_search?pretty=true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""query"" : {
        ""match_all"" : {}
    }
}'

Or on all the indices:
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_search?pretty=true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
{
    ""query"" : {
        ""match_all"" : {}
    }
}'

{One liner teaser}: And the cool part about that? You can easily search on multiple twitter users (indices), with different boost levels per user (index), making social search so much simpler (results from my friends rank higher than results from friends of my friends).
Distributed, Highly Available
Let’s face it, things will fail….
Elasticsearch is a highly available and distributed search engine. Each index is broken down into shards, and each shard can have one or more replicas. By default, an index is created with 5 shards and 1 replica per shard (5/1). There are many topologies that can be used, including 1/10 (improve search performance), or 20/1 (improve indexing performance, with search executed in a map reduce fashion across shards).
In order to play with the distributed nature of Elasticsearch, simply bring more nodes up and shut down nodes. The system will continue to serve requests (make sure you use the correct http port) with the latest data indexed.
Where to go from here?
We have just covered a very small portion of what Elasticsearch is all about. For more information, please refer to the elastic.co website. General questions can be asked on the Elastic Discourse forum or on IRC on Freenode at #elasticsearch. The Elasticsearch GitHub repository is reserved for bug reports and feature requests only.
Building from Source
Elasticsearch uses Gradle for its build system.
In order to create a distribution, simply run the ./gradlew assemble command in the cloned directory.
The distribution for each project will be created under the build/distributions directory in that project.
See the TESTING file for more information about running the Elasticsearch test suite.
Upgrading from older Elasticsearch versions
In order to ensure a smooth upgrade process from earlier versions of Elasticsearch, please see our upgrade documentation for more details on the upgrade process.

Front-end Job Interview Questions
This file contains a number of front-end interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.
Note: Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.

Getting started
Install JSON Server
npm install -g json-server

Create a db.json file with some data
{
  ""posts"": [
    { ""id"": 1, ""title"": ""json-server"", ""author"": ""typicode"" }
  ],
  ""comments"": [
    { ""id"": 1, ""body"": ""some comment"", ""postId"": 1 }
  ],
  ""profile"": { ""name"": ""typicode"" }
}
Start JSON Server
json-server --watch db.json
Now if you go to http://localhost:3000/posts/1, you'll get
{ ""id"": 1, ""title"": ""json-server"", ""author"": ""typicode"" }
Also when doing requests, it's good to know that:

If you make POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests, changes will be automatically and safely saved to db.json using lowdb.
Your request body JSON should be object enclosed, just like the GET output. (for example {""name"": ""Foobar""})
Id values are not mutable. Any id value in the body of your PUT or PATCH request will be ignored. Only a value set in a POST request will be respected, but only if not already taken.
A POST, PUT or PATCH request should include a Content-Type: application/json header to use the JSON in the request body. Otherwise it will result in a 200 OK but without changes being made to the data.

Routes
Based on the previous db.json file, here are all the default routes. You can also add other routes using --routes.
Plural routes
GET    /posts
GET    /posts/1
POST   /posts
PUT    /posts/1
PATCH  /posts/1
DELETE /posts/1

Singular routes
GET    /profile
POST   /profile
PUT    /profile
PATCH  /profile

Filter
Use . to access deep properties
GET /posts?title=json-server&author=typicode
GET /posts?id=1&id=2
GET /comments?author.name=typicode

Paginate
Use _page and optionally _limit to paginate returned data.
In the Link header you'll get first, prev, next and last links.
GET /posts?_page=7
GET /posts?_page=7&_limit=20

10 items are returned by default
Sort
Add _sort and _order (ascending order by default)
GET /posts?_sort=views&_order=asc
GET /posts/1/comments?_sort=votes&_order=asc

For multiple fields, use the following format:
GET /posts?_sort=user,views&_order=desc,asc

Slice
Add _start and _end or _limit (an X-Total-Count header is included in the response)
GET /posts?_start=20&_end=30
GET /posts/1/comments?_start=20&_end=30
GET /posts/1/comments?_start=20&_limit=10

Works exactly as Array.slice (i.e. _start is inclusive and _end exclusive)
Operators
Add _gte or _lte for getting a range
GET /posts?views_gte=10&views_lte=20

Add _ne to exclude a value
GET /posts?id_ne=1

Add _like to filter (RegExp supported)
GET /posts?title_like=server

Full-text search
Add q
GET /posts?q=internet

Relationships
To include children resources, add _embed
GET /posts?_embed=comments
GET /posts/1?_embed=comments

To include parent resource, add _expand
GET /comments?_expand=post
GET /comments/1?_expand=post

To get or create nested resources (by default one level, add custom routes for more)
GET  /posts/1/comments
POST /posts/1/comments

Database
GET /db

Homepage
Returns default index file or serves ./public directory
GET /

Extras
Static file server
You can use JSON Server to serve your HTML, JS and CSS, simply create a ./public directory
or use --static to set a different static files directory.
mkdir public
echo 'hello world' > public/index.html
json-server db.json
json-server db.json --static ./some-other-dir
Alternative port
You can start JSON Server on other ports with the --port flag:
$ json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
Access from anywhere
You can access your fake API from anywhere using CORS and JSONP.
Remote schema
You can load remote schemas.
$ json-server http://example.com/file.json
$ json-server http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/db
Generate random data
Using JS instead of a JSON file, you can create data programmatically.
// index.js
module.exports = () => {
  const data = { users: [] }
  // Create 1000 users
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    data.users.push({ id: i, name: `user${i}` })
  }
  return data
}
$ json-server index.js
Tip use modules like Faker, Casual, Chance or JSON Schema Faker.
HTTPS
There are many ways to set up SSL in development. One simple way is to use hotel.
Add custom routes
Create a routes.json file. Pay attention to start every route with /.
{
  ""/api/*"": ""/$1"",
  ""/:resource/:id/show"": ""/:resource/:id"",
  ""/posts/:category"": ""/posts?category=:category"",
  ""/articles\\?id=:id"": ""/posts/:id""
}
Start JSON Server with --routes option.
json-server db.json --routes routes.json
Now you can access resources using additional routes.
/api/posts # → /posts
/api/posts/1  # → /posts/1
/posts/1/show # → /posts/1
/posts/javascript # → /posts?category=javascript
/articles?id=1 # → /posts/1
Add middlewares
You can add your middlewares from the CLI using --middlewares option:
// hello.js
module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  res.header('X-Hello', 'World')
  next()
}
json-server db.json --middlewares ./hello.js
json-server db.json --middlewares ./first.js ./second.js

  --version, -v      Show version number                               [boolean]

Examples:
  json-server db.json
  json-server file.js
  json-server http://example.com/db.json

https://github.com/typicode/json-server

You can also set options in a json-server.json configuration file.
{
  ""port"": 3000
}
Module
If you need to add authentication, validation, or any behavior, you can use the project as a module in combination with other Express middlewares.
Simple example
$ npm install json-server --save-dev
// server.js
const jsonServer = require('json-server')
const server = jsonServer.create()
const router = jsonServer.router('db.json')
const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults()

server.use(middlewares)
server.use(router)
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('JSON Server is running')
})
$ node server.js
The path you provide to the jsonServer.router function  is relative to the directory from where you launch your node process. If you run the above code from another directory, it’s better to use an absolute path:
const path = require('path')
const router = jsonServer.router(path.join(__dirname, 'db.json'))
For an in-memory database, simply pass an object to jsonServer.router().
Please note also that jsonServer.router() can be used in existing Express projects.
Custom routes example
Let's say you want a route that echoes query parameters and another one that set a timestamp on every resource created.
const jsonServer = require('json-server')
const server = jsonServer.create()
const router = jsonServer.router('db.json')
const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults()

// Set default middlewares (logger, static, cors and no-cache)
server.use(middlewares)

// Add custom routes before JSON Server router
server.get('/echo', (req, res) => {
  res.jsonp(req.query)
})

// To handle POST, PUT and PATCH you need to use a body-parser
// You can use the one used by JSON Server
server.use(jsonServer.bodyParser)
server.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    req.body.createdAt = Date.now()
  }
  // Continue to JSON Server router
  next()
})

// Use default router
server.use(router)
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('JSON Server is running')
})
Access control example
const jsonServer = require('json-server')
const server = jsonServer.create()
const router = jsonServer.router('db.json')
const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults()

server.use(middlewares)
server.use((req, res, next) => {
 if (isAuthorized(req)) { // add your authorization logic here
   next() // continue to JSON Server router
 } else {
   res.sendStatus(401)
 }
})
server.use(router)
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('JSON Server is running')
})
Custom output example
To modify responses, overwrite router.render method:
// In this example, returned resources will be wrapped in a body property
router.render = (req, res) => {
  res.jsonp({
    body: res.locals.data
  })
}
You can set your own status code for the response:
// In this example we simulate a server side error response
router.render = (req, res) => {
  res.status(500).jsonp({
    error: ""error message here""
  })
}
Rewriter example
To add rewrite rules, use jsonServer.rewriter():
// Add this before server.use(router)
server.use(jsonServer.rewriter({
  '/api/*': '/$1',
  '/blog/:resource/:id/show': '/:resource/:id'
}))
Mounting JSON Server on another endpoint example
Alternatively, you can also mount the router on /api.
server.use('/api', router)
API
jsonServer.create()
Returns an Express server.
jsonServer.defaults([options])
Returns middlewares used by JSON Server.

options

static path to static files
logger enable logger middleware (default: true)
bodyParser enable body-parser middleware (default: true)
noCors disable CORS (default: false)
readOnly accept only GET requests (default: false)



jsonServer.router([path|object])
Returns JSON Server router.
Deployment
You can deploy JSON Server. For example, JSONPlaceholder is an online fake API powered by JSON Server and running on Heroku.

RxJava: Reactive Extensions for the JVM



RxJava is a Java VM implementation of Reactive Extensions: a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures.
Version 2.x (Javadoc)

single dependency: Reactive-Streams
continued support for Java 6+ & Android 2.3+
performance gains through design changes learned through the 1.x cycle and through Reactive-Streams-Commons research project.
Java 8 lambda-friendly API
non-opinionated about source of concurrency (threads, pools, event loops, fibers, actors, etc)
async or synchronous execution
virtual time and schedulers for parameterized concurrency

Version 2.x and 1.x will live side-by-side for several years. They will have different group ids (io.reactivex.rxjava2 vs io.reactivex) and namespaces (io.reactivex vs rx).
See the differences between version 1.x and 2.x in the wiki article What's different in 2.0. Learn more about RxJava in general on the Wiki Home.
Version 1.x
The 1.x version is end-of-life as of March 31, 2018. No further development, support, maintenance, PRs and updates will happen. The Javadoc of the very last version, 1.3.8, will remain accessible.
Getting started
Setting up the dependency
The first step is to include RxJava 2 into your project, for example, as a Gradle compile dependency:
implementation ""io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.x.y""
(Please replace x and y with the latest version numbers: 
)
Hello World
The second is to write the Hello World program:
package rxjava.examples;

import io.reactivex.*;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flowable.just(""Hello world"").subscribe(System.out::println);
    }
}
If your platform doesn't support Java 8 lambdas (yet), you have to create an inner class of Consumer manually:
import io.reactivex.functions.Consumer;

Flowable.just(""Hello world"")
  .subscribe(new Consumer<String>() {
      @Override public void accept(String s) {
          System.out.println(s);
      }
  });
Base classes
RxJava 2 features several base classes you can discover operators on:

io.reactivex.Flowable: 0..N flows, supporting Reactive-Streams and backpressure
io.reactivex.Observable: 0..N flows, no backpressure,
io.reactivex.Single: a flow of exactly 1 item or an error,
io.reactivex.Completable: a flow without items but only a completion or error signal,
io.reactivex.Maybe: a flow with no items, exactly one item or an error.

Some terminology
Upstream, downstream
The dataflows in RxJava consist of a source, zero or more intermediate steps followed by a data consumer or combinator step (where the step is responsible to consume the dataflow by some means):
source.operator1().operator2().operator3().subscribe(consumer);

source.flatMap(value -> source.operator1().operator2().operator3());
Here, if we imagine ourselves on operator2, looking to the left towards the source, is called the upstream. Looking to the right towards the subscriber/consumer, is called the downstream. This is often more apparent when each element is written on a separate line:
source
  .operator1()
  .operator2()
  .operator3()
  .subscribe(consumer)
Objects in motion
In RxJava's documentation, emission, emits, item, event, signal, data and message are considered synonyms and represent the object traveling along the dataflow.
Backpressure
When the dataflow runs through asynchronous steps, each step may perform different things with different speed. To avoid overwhelming such steps, which usually would manifest itself as increased memory usage due to temporary buffering or the need for skipping/dropping data, a so-called backpressure is applied, which is a form of flow control where the steps can express how many items are they ready to process. This allows constraining the memory usage of the dataflows in situations where there is generally no way for a step to know how many items the upstream will send to it.
In RxJava, the dedicated Flowable class is designated to support backpressure and Observable is dedicated for the non-backpressured operations (short sequences, GUI interactions, etc.). The other types, Single, Maybe and Completable don't support backpressure nor should they; there is always room to store one item temporarily.
Assembly time
The preparation of dataflows by applying various intermediate operators happens in the so-called assembly time:
Flowable<Integer> flow = Flowable.range(1, 5)
.map(v -> v * v)
.filter(v -> v % 3 == 0)
;
At this point, the data is not flowing yet and no side-effects are happening.
Subscription time
This is a temporary state when subscribe() is called on a flow that establishes the chain of processing steps internally:
flow.subscribe(System.out::println)
This is when the subscription side-effects are triggered (see doOnSubscribe). Some sources block or start emitting items right away in this state.
Runtime
This is the state when the flows are actively emitting items, errors or completion signals:
Observable.create(emitter -> {
     while (!emitter.isDisposed()) {
         long time = System.currentTimeMillis();
         emitter.onNext(time);
         if (time % 2 != 0) {
             emitter.onError(new IllegalStateException(""Odd millisecond!""));
             break;
         }
     }
})
.subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);
Practically, this is when the body of the given example above executes.
Simple background computation
One of the common use cases for RxJava is to run some computation, network request on a background thread and show the results (or error) on the UI thread:
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;

Flowable.fromCallable(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000); //  imitate expensive computation
    return ""Done"";
})
  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
  .observeOn(Schedulers.single())
  .subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);

Thread.sleep(2000); // <--- wait for the flow to finish
This style of chaining methods is called a fluent API which resembles the builder pattern. However, RxJava's reactive types are immutable; each of the method calls returns a new Flowable with added behavior. To illustrate, the example can be rewritten as follows:
Flowable<String> source = Flowable.fromCallable(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000); //  imitate expensive computation
    return ""Done"";
});

Flowable<String> runBackground = source.subscribeOn(Schedulers.io());

Flowable<String> showForeground = runBackground.observeOn(Schedulers.single());

showForeground.subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);

Thread.sleep(2000);
Typically, you can move computations or blocking IO to some other thread via subscribeOn. Once the data is ready, you can make sure they get processed on the foreground or GUI thread via observeOn.
Schedulers
RxJava operators don't work with Threads or ExecutorServices directly but with so called Schedulers that abstract away sources of concurrency behind a uniform API. RxJava 2 features several standard schedulers accessible via Schedulers utility class.

Schedulers.computation(): Run computation intensive work on a fixed number of dedicated threads in the background. Most asynchronous operator use this as their default Scheduler.
Schedulers.io(): Run I/O-like or blocking operations on a dynamically changing set of threads.
Schedulers.single(): Run work on a single thread in a sequential and FIFO manner.
Schedulers.trampoline(): Run work in a sequential and FIFO manner in one of the participating threads, usually for testing purposes.

These are available on all JVM platforms but some specific platforms, such as Android, have their own typical Schedulers defined: AndroidSchedulers.mainThread(), SwingScheduler.instance() or JavaFXSchedulers.gui().
In addition, there is option to wrap an existing Executor (and its subtypes such as ExecutorService) into a Scheduler via Schedulers.from(Executor). This can be used, for example, to have a larger but still fixed pool of threads (unlike computation() and io() respectively).
The Thread.sleep(2000); at the end is no accident. In RxJava the default Schedulers run on daemon threads, which means once the Java main thread exits, they all get stopped and background computations may never happen. Sleeping for some time in this example situations lets you see the output of the flow on the console with time to spare.
Concurrency within a flow
Flows in RxJava are sequential in nature split into processing stages that may run concurrently with each other:
Flowable.range(1, 10)
  .observeOn(Schedulers.computation())
  .map(v -> v * v)
  .blockingSubscribe(System.out::println);
This example flow squares the numbers from 1 to 10 on the computation Scheduler and consumes the results on the ""main"" thread (more precisely, the caller thread of blockingSubscribe). However, the lambda v -> v * v doesn't run in parallel for this flow; it receives the values 1 to 10 on the same computation thread one after the other.
Parallel processing
Processing the numbers 1 to 10 in parallel is a bit more involved:
Flowable.range(1, 10)
  .flatMap(v ->
      Flowable.just(v)
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
        .map(w -> w * w)
  )
  .blockingSubscribe(System.out::println);
Practically, parallelism in RxJava means running independent flows and merging their results back into a single flow. The operator flatMap does this by first mapping each number from 1 to 10 into its own individual Flowable, runs them and merges the computed squares.
Note, however, that flatMap doesn't guarantee any order and the end result from the inner flows may end up interleaved. There are alternative operators:

concatMap that maps and runs one inner flow at a time and
concatMapEager which runs all inner flows ""at once"" but the output flow will be in the order those inner flows were created.

Alternatively, the Flowable.parallel() operator and the ParallelFlowable type help achieve the same parallel processing pattern:
Flowable.range(1, 10)
  .parallel()
  .runOn(Schedulers.computation())
  .map(v -> v * v)
  .sequential()
  .blockingSubscribe(System.out::println);
Dependent sub-flows
flatMap is a powerful operator and helps in a lot of situations. For example, given a service that returns a Flowable, we'd like to call another service with values emitted by the first service:
Flowable<Inventory> inventorySource = warehouse.getInventoryAsync();

inventorySource.flatMap(inventoryItem ->
    erp.getDemandAsync(inventoryItem.getId())
    .map(demand 
        -> System.out.println(""Item "" + inventoryItem.getName() + "" has demand "" + demand));
  )
  .subscribe();
Continuations
Sometimes, when an item has become available, one would like to perform some dependent computations on it. This is sometimes called continuations and, depending on what should happen and what types are involved, may involve various operators to accomplish.
Dependent
The most typical scenario is to given a value, invoke another service, await and continue with its result:
service.apiCall()
.flatMap(value -> service.anotherApiCall(value))
.flatMap(next -> service.finalCall(next))
It is often the case also that later sequences would require values from earlier mappings. This can be achieved by moving the outer flatMap into the inner parts of the previous flatMap for example:
service.apiCall()
.flatMap(value ->
    service.anotherApiCall(value)
    .flatMap(next -> service.finalCallBoth(value, next))
)
Here, the original value will be available inside the inner flatMap, courtesy of lambda variable capture.
Non-dependent
In other scenarios, the result(s) of the first source/dataflow is irrelevant and one would like to continue with a quasi independent another source. Here, flatMap works as well:
Observable continued = sourceObservable.flatMapSingle(ignored -> someSingleSource)
continued.map(v -> v.toString())
  .subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);
however, the continuation in this case stays Observable instead of the likely more appropriate Single. (This is understandable because
from the perspective of flatMapSingle, sourceObservable is a multi-valued source and thus the mapping may result in multiple values as well).
Often though there is a way that is somewhat more expressive (and also lower overhead) by using Completable as the mediator and its operator andThen to resume with something else:
sourceObservable
  .ignoreElements()           // returns Completable
  .andThen(someSingleSource)
  .map(v -> v.toString())
The only dependency between the sourceObservable and the someSingleSource is that the former should complete normally in order for the latter to be consumed.
Deferred-dependent
Sometimes, there is an implicit data dependency between the previous sequence and the new sequence that, for some reason, was not flowing through the ""regular channels"". One would be inclined to write such continuations as follows:
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();

Observable.range(1, 10)
  .doOnNext(ignored -> count.incrementAndGet())
  .ignoreElements()
  .andThen(Single.just(count.get()))
  .subscribe(System.out::println);
Unfortunately, this prints 0 because Single.just(count.get()) is evaluated at assembly time when the dataflow hasn't even run yet. We need something that defers the evaluation of this Single source until runtime when the main source completes:
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();

Observable.range(1, 10)
  .doOnNext(ignored -> count.incrementAndGet())
  .ignoreElements()
  .andThen(Single.defer(() -> Single.just(count.get())))
  .subscribe(System.out::println);
or
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();

Observable.range(1, 10)
  .doOnNext(ignored -> count.incrementAndGet())
  .ignoreElements()
  .andThen(Single.fromCallable(() -> count.get()))
  .subscribe(System.out::println);
Type conversions
Sometimes, a source or service returns a different type than the flow that is supposed to work with it. For example, in the inventory example above, getDemandAsync could return a Single<DemandRecord>. If the code example is left unchanged, this will result in a compile time error (however, often with misleading error message about lack of overload).
In such situations, there are usually two options to fix the transformation: 1) convert to the desired type or 2) find and use an overload of the specific operator supporting the different type.
Converting to the desired type
Each reactive base class features operators that can perform such conversions, including the protocol conversions, to match some other type. The following matrix shows the available conversion options:




Flowable
Observable
Single
Maybe
Completable




Flowable

toObservable
first, firstOrError, single, singleOrError, last, lastOrError1
firstElement, singleElement, lastElement
ignoreElements


Observable
toFlowable2

first, firstOrError, single, singleOrError, last, lastOrError1
firstElement, singleElement, lastElement
ignoreElements


Single
toFlowable3
toObservable

toMaybe
ignoreElement


Maybe
toFlowable3
toObservable
toSingle

ignoreElement


Completable
toFlowable
toObservable
toSingle
toMaybe




1: When turning a multi-valued source into a single valued source, one should decide which of the many source values should be considered as the result.
2: Turning an Observable into Flowable requires an additional decision: what to do with the potential unconstrained flow
of the source Observable? There are several strategies available (such as buffering, dropping, keeping the latest) via the BackpressureStrategy parameter or via standard Flowable operators such as onBackpressureBuffer, onBackpressureDrop, onBackpressureLatest which also
allow further customization of the backpressure behavior.
3: When there is only (at most) one source item, there is no problem with backpressure as it can be always stored until the downstream is ready to consume.
Using an overload with the desired type
Many frequently used operator has overloads that can deal with the other types. These are usually named with the suffix of the target type:



Operator
Overloads




flatMap
flatMapSingle, flatMapMaybe, flatMapCompletable, flatMapIterable


concatMap
concatMapSingle, concatMapMaybe, concatMapCompletable, concatMapIterable


switchMap
switchMapSingle, switchMapMaybe, switchMapCompletable



The reason these operators have a suffix instead of simply having the same name with different signature is type erasure. Java doesn't consider signatures such as operator(Function<T, Single<R>>) and operator(Function<T, Maybe<R>>) different (unlike C#) and due to erasure, the two operators would end up as duplicate methods with the same signature.
Operator naming conventions
Naming in programming is one of the hardest things as names are expected to be not long, expressive, capturing and easily memorable. Unfortunately, the target language (and pre-existing conventions) may not give too much help in this regard (unusable keywords, type erasure, type ambiguities, etc.).
Unusable keywords
In the original Rx.NET, the operator that emits a single item and then completes is called Return(T). Since the Java convention is to have a lowercase letter start a method name, this would have been return(T) which is a keyword in Java and thus not available. Therefore, RxJava chose to name this operator just(T). The same limitation exists for the operator Switch, which had to be named switchOnNext. Yet another example is Catch which was named onErrorResumeNext.
Type erasure
Many operators that expect the user to provide some function returning a reactive type can't be overloaded because the type erasure around a Function<T, X> turns such method signatures into duplicates. RxJava chose to name such operators by appending the type as suffix as well:
Flowable<R> flatMap(Function<? super T, ? extends Publisher<? extends R>> mapper)

Flowable<R> flatMapMaybe(Function<? super T, ? extends MaybeSource<? extends R>> mapper)
Type ambiguities
Even though certain operators have no problems from type erasure, their signature may turn up being ambiguous, especially if one uses Java 8 and lambdas. For example, there are several overloads of concatWith taking the various other reactive base types as arguments (for providing convenience and performance benefits in the underlying implementation):
Flowable<T> concatWith(Publisher<? extends T> other);

Flowable<T> concatWith(SingleSource<? extends T> other);
Both Publisher and SingleSource appear as functional interfaces (types with one abstract method) and may encourage users to try to provide a lambda expression:
someSource.concatWith(s -> Single.just(2))
.subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);
Unfortunately, this approach doesn't work and the example does not print 2 at all. In fact, since version 2.1.10, it doesn't
even compile because at least 4 concatWith overloads exist and the compiler finds the code above ambiguous.
The user in such situations probably wanted to defer some computation until the someSource has completed, thus the correct
unambiguous operator should have been defer:
someSource.concatWith(Single.defer(() -> Single.just(2)))
.subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);
Sometimes, a suffix is added to avoid logical ambiguities that may compile but produce the wrong type in a flow:
Flowable<T> merge(Publisher<? extends Publisher<? extends T>> sources);

Flowable<T> mergeArray(Publisher<? extends T>... sources);
This can get also ambiguous when functional interface types get involved as the type argument T.
Error handling
Dataflows can fail, at which point the error is emitted to the consumer(s). Sometimes though, multiple sources may fail at which point there is a choice whether or not wait for all of them to complete or fail. To indicate this opportunity, many operator names are suffixed with the DelayError words (while others feature a delayError or delayErrors boolean flag in one of their overloads):
Flowable<T> concat(Publisher<? extends Publisher<? extends T>> sources);

Flowable<T> concatDelayError(Publisher<? extends Publisher<? extends T>> sources);
Of course, suffixes of various kinds may appear together:
Flowable<T> concatArrayEagerDelayError(Publisher<? extends T>... sources);
Base class vs base type
The base classes can be considered heavy due to the sheer number of static and instance methods on them. RxJava 2's design was heavily influenced by the Reactive Streams specification, therefore, the library features a class and an interface per each reactive type:



Type
Class
Interface
Consumer




0..N backpressured
Flowable
Publisher1
Subscriber


0..N unbounded
Observable
ObservableSource2
Observer


1 element or error
Single
SingleSource
SingleObserver


0..1 element or error
Maybe
MaybeSource
MaybeObserver


0 element or error
Completable
CompletableSource
CompletableObserver



1The org.reactivestreams.Publisher is part of the external Reactive Streams library. It is the main type to interact with other reactive libraries through a standardized mechanism governed by the Reactive Streams specification.
2The naming convention of the interface was to append Source to the semi-traditional class name. There is no FlowableSource since Publisher is provided by the Reactive Streams library (and subtyping it wouldn't have helped with interoperation either). These interfaces are, however, not standard in the sense of the Reactive Streams specification and are currently RxJava specific only.

Versioning
Version 2.x is now considered stable and final. Version 1.x will be supported for several years along with 2.x. Enhancements and bugfixes will be synchronized between the two in a timely manner.
Minor 2.x increments (such as 2.1, 2.2, etc) will occur when non-trivial new functionality is added or significant enhancements or bug fixes occur that may have behavioral changes that may affect some edge cases (such as dependence on behavior resulting from a bug). An example of an enhancement that would classify as this is adding reactive pull backpressure support to an operator that previously did not support it. This should be backwards compatible but does behave differently.
Patch 2.x.y increments (such as 2.0.0 -> 2.0.1, 2.3.1 -> 2.3.2, etc) will occur for bug fixes and trivial functionality (like adding a method overload). New functionality marked with an @Beta or @Experimental annotation can also be added in patch releases to allow rapid exploration and iteration of unstable new functionality.
@Beta
APIs marked with the @Beta annotation at the class or method level are subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even removed, at any time. If your code is a library itself (i.e. it is used on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control), you should not use beta APIs, unless you repackage them (e.g. using ProGuard, shading, etc).
@Experimental
APIs marked with the @Experimental annotation at the class or method level will almost certainly change. They can be modified in any way, or even removed, at any time. You should not use or rely on them in any production code. They are purely to allow broad testing and feedback.
@Deprecated
APIs marked with the @Deprecated annotation at the class or method level will remain supported until the next major release but it is recommended to stop using them.
io.reactivex.internal.*
All code inside the io.reactivex.internal.* packages is considered private API and should not be relied upon at all. It can change at any time.

Bitcoin Core integration/staging tree

https://bitcoincore.org
What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.
For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/, or read the
original whitepaper.
License
Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See COPYING for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.
Development Process
The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. Tags are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.
The contribution workflow is described in CONTRIBUTING.md
and useful hints for developers can be found in doc/developer-notes.md.
Testing
Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
Automated Testing
Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: make check. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in /src/test/README.md.
There are also regression and integration tests, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the test dependencies are installed) with: test/functional/test_runner.py
The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.
Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing
Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
Translations
Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
Bitcoin Core's Transifex page.
Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
translation process for details on how this works.
Important: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
Translators should also subscribe to the mailing list.

Why Netdata
Netdata has a quite different approach to monitoring.
Netdata is a monitoring agent you install on all your systems. It is:

a metrics collector - for system and application metrics (including web servers, databases, containers, etc)
a time-series database - all stored in memory (does not touch the disks while it runs)
a metrics visualizer - super fast, interactive, modern, optimized for anomaly detection
an alarms notification engine - an advanced watchdog for detecting performance and availability issues

All the above, are packaged together in a very flexible, extremely modular, distributed application.
This is how netdata compares to other monitoring solutions:



netdata
others (open-source and commercial)




High resolution metrics (1s granularity)
Low resolution metrics (10s granularity at best)


Monitors everything, thousands of metrics per node
Monitor just a few metrics


UI is super fast, optimized for anomaly detection
UI is good for just an abstract view


Meaningful presentation, to help you understand the metrics
You have to know the metrics before you start


Install and get results immediately
Long preparation is required to get any useful results


Use it for troubleshooting performance problems
Use them to get statistics of past performance


Kills the console for tracing performance issues
The console is always required for troubleshooting


Requires zero dedicated resources
Require large dedicated resources



Netdata is open-source, free, super fast, very easy, completely open, extremely efficient,
flexible and integrate-able.
It has been designed by SysAdmins, DevOps and Developers for troubleshooting performance problems,
not just visualize metrics.
News

The release introduces major additions to Kubernetes monitoring, with tens of new charts for Kubelet, kube-proxy and coredns metrics, as well as significant improvements to the netdata helm chart.
Two new collectors were added, to monitor Docker hub and Docker engine metrics.
Finally, v1.14  adds support for version 2 cgroups, OpenLDAP over TLS, NVIDIA SMI free and per process memory and configurable syslog facilities.
Mar 14th, 2019 - netdata v1.13.0 released!
Release 1.13.0 contains 14 bug fixes and 8 improvements.
netdata has taken the first step into the world of Kubernetes, with a beta version of a Helm chart for deployment to a k8s cluster and proper naming of the cgroup containers. We have big plans for Kubernetes, so stay tuned!
A major refactoring of the python.d plugin has resulted in a dramatic decrease of the required memory, making netdata even more resource efficient.
We also added charts for IPC shared memory segments and total memory used.
Feb 28th, 2019 - netdata v1.12.2 released!
Patch release 1.12.2 contains 7 bug fixes and 4 improvements.
The main motivation behind a new patch release is the introduction of a stable release channel.
A ""stable"" installation and update channel was always on our roadmap, but it became a necessity when we realized that our users in China could not use the nightly releases published on Google Cloud. The ""stable"" channel is based on our official GitHub releases and uses assets hosted on GitHub.
We are also introducing a new Oracle DB collector module, implemented in Python.
Feb 21st, 2019 - netdata v1.12.1 released!
Patch release 1.12.1 contains 22 bug fixes and 8 improvements.

Health monitoring improvements: network interface congestion alarm restored, alerta.io, conntrack_max.
my-netdatamenu has been refactored.
Packaging: openrc service definition got a few improvements.


Sep 18, 2018 - netdata has its own organization
Netdata used to be a firehol.org project, accessible as firehol/netdata.
Netdata now has its own github organization netdata, so all github URLs are now netdata/netdata. The old github URLs, repo clones, forks, etc redirect automatically to the new repo.
How it works
Netdata is a highly efficient, highly modular, metrics management engine. Its lockless design makes it ideal for concurrent operations on the metrics.

This is how it works:



Function
Description
Documentation




Collect
Multiple independent data collection workers are collecting metrics from their sources using the optimal protocol for each application and push the metrics to the database. Each data collection worker has lockless write access to the metrics it collects.
collectors


Store
Metrics are stored in RAM in a round robin database (ring buffer), using a custom made floating point number for minimal footprint.
database


Check
A lockless independent watchdog is evaluating health checks on the collected metrics, triggers alarms, maintains a health transaction log and dispatches alarm notifications.
health


Stream
An lockless independent worker is streaming metrics, in full detail and in real-time, to remote netdata servers, as soon as they are collected.
streaming


Archive
A lockless independent worker is down-sampling the metrics and pushes them to backend time-series databases.
backends


Query
Multiple independent workers are attached to the internal web server, servicing API requests, including data queries.
web/api



The result is a highly efficient, low latency system, supporting multiple readers and one writer on each metric.

Features

This is what you should expect from Netdata:
General

1s granularity - the highest possible resolution for all metrics.
Unlimited metrics - collects all the available metrics, the more the better.
1% CPU utilization of a single core - it is super fast, unbelievably optimized.
A few MB of RAM - by default it uses 25MB RAM. You size it.
Zero disk I/O - while it runs, it does not load or save anything (except error and access logs).
Zero configuration - auto-detects everything, it can collect up to 10000 metrics per server out of the box.
Zero maintenance - You just run it, it does the rest.
Zero dependencies - it is even its own web server, for its static web files and its web API (though its plugins may require additional libraries, depending on the applications monitored).
Scales to infinity - you can install it on all your servers, containers, VMs and IoTs. Metrics are not centralized by default, so there is no limit.
Several operating modes - Autonomous host monitoring (the default), headless data collector, forwarding proxy, store and forward proxy, central multi-host monitoring, in all possible configurations. Each node may have different metrics retention policy and run with or without health monitoring.

Health Monitoring & Alarms

Sophisticated alerting - comes with hundreds of alarms, out of the box! Supports dynamic thresholds, hysteresis, alarm templates, multiple role-based notification methods.
Notifications: alerta.io, amazon sns, discordapp.com, email, flock.com, irc, kavenegar.com, messagebird.com, pagerduty.com, prowl, pushbullet.com, pushover.net, rocket.chat, slack.com, smstools3, syslog, telegram.org, twilio.com, web and custom notifications.

Integrations

time-series dbs - can archive its metrics to graphite, opentsdb, prometheus, json document DBs, in the same or lower resolution (lower: to prevent it from congesting these servers due to the amount of data collected).

Visualization

Stunning interactive dashboards - mouse, touchpad and touch-screen friendly in 2 themes: slate (dark) and white.
Amazingly fast visualization - responds to all queries in less than 1 ms per metric, even on low-end hardware.
Visual anomaly detection - the dashboards are optimized for detecting anomalies visually.
Embeddable - its charts can be embedded on your web pages, wikis and blogs. You can even use Atlassian's Confluence as a monitoring dashboard.
Customizable - custom dashboards can be built using simple HTML (no javascript necessary).

Positive and negative values
To improve clarity on charts, netdata dashboards present positive values for metrics representing read, input, inbound, received and negative values for metrics representing write, output, outbound, sent.

Netdata charts showing the bandwidth and packets of a network interface. received is positive and sent is negative.
Autoscaled y-axis
Netdata charts automatically zoom vertically, to visualize the variation of each metric within the visible time-frame.

A zero based stacked chart, automatically switches to an auto-scaled area chart when a single dimension is selected.
Charts are synchronized
Charts on netdata dashboards are synchronized to each other. There is no master chart. Any chart can be panned or zoomed at any time, and all other charts will follow.

Charts are panned by dragging them with the mouse. Charts can be zoomed in/out withSHIFT + mouse wheel while the mouse pointer is over a chart.

The visible time-frame (pan and zoom) is propagated from netdata server to netdata server, when navigating via the my-netdata menu.

Highlighted time-frame
To improve visual anomaly detection across charts, the user can highlight a time-frame (by pressing ALT + mouse selection) on all charts.

A highlighted time-frame can be given by pressing ALT + mouse selection on any chart. Netdata will highlight the same range on all charts.

Highlighted ranges are propagated from netdata server to netdata server, when navigating via the my-netdata menu.

What does it monitor
Netdata data collection is extensible - you can monitor anything you can get a metric for.
Its Plugin API supports all programing languages (anything can be a netdata plugin, BASH, python, perl, node.js, java, Go, ruby, etc).

For better performance, most system related plugins (cpu, memory, disks, filesystems, networking, etc) have been written in C.
For faster development and easier contributions, most application related plugins (databases, web servers, etc) have been written in python.

Is it any good?
Yes.
When people first hear about a new product, they frequently ask if it is any good. A Hacker News user remarked:

Note to self: Starting immediately, all raganwald projects will have a “Is it any good?” section in the readme, and the answer shall be “yes."".

So, we follow the tradition...
Is it awesome?

Material design icons
Material design icons is the official icon set from Google.  The icons are designed under the material design guidelines.
3.0.1 Update

Changed license in package.json.
Added missing device symbol sprites.

3.0.0 Update
License change to Apache 2.0!
Getting Started
Read the developer guide on how to use the material design icons in your project.
Using a font collection
The iconfont folder contains pre-generated font files that can be included in a project. This is especially convenient for the web; however, it is generally better to link to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:
<link href=""https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons""
      rel=""stylesheet"">
Read more in the font portion of our full developer guide.
Using symbols and sprites
The css-sprite and svg-sprite folders contain pre-generated sprite sheets, as well as svg symbols that can be <use>d more directly and with fewer constraints. Instructions for using them are in the sprites documentation.
Polymer icons
If you wish to use the icon set with Polymer, we recommend consuming them via the <iron-icons> element (<core-icons> in v0.5).
License
We have made these icons available for you to incorporate into your products under the Apache License Version 2.0. Feel free to remix and re-share these icons and documentation in your products.
We'd love attribution in your app's about screen, but it's not required. The only thing we ask is that you not re-sell these icons.

 Markdown Here
Visit the website.
Get it for Chrome.
Get it for Firefox.
Get it for Safari.
Get it for Thunderbird and Postbox.
Get it for Opera.
Discuss it and ask questions in the Google Group.
Markdown Here is a Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Thunderbird extension that lets you write email† in Markdown‡ and render them before sending. It also supports syntax highlighting (just specify the language in a fenced code block).
Writing email with code in it is pretty tedious. Writing Markdown with code in it is easy. I found myself writing email in Markdown in the Github in-browser editor, then copying the preview into email. This is a pretty absurd workflow, so I decided create a tool to write and render Markdown right in the email.
To discover what can be done with Markdown in Markdown Here, check out the Markdown Here Cheatsheet and the other wiki pages.
†: And Google Groups posts, and Blogger posts, and Evernote notes, and Wordpress posts! See more.
‡: And TeX mathematical formulae!

Or go to the ""Tools > Add-ons"" menu and then search for ""Markdown Here"".
After installing, make sure to restart Firefox/Thunderbird!
Note: It takes up to a month for Mozilla to approve changes to the Firefox/Thunderbird extension, so updates (features, fixes) will lag behind what is shown here. You can manually choose to install the newest version before it's reviewed from the list of versions: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-here/versions/
Manual/Development

Clone this repo.
Follow the instructions in the MDN ""Setting up an extension development environment"" article.

Safari
Download the extension directly. When it has finished downloading, double click it to install.
Preferences
To get to the Markdown Here preferences, open the Safari preferences and then go to the ""Extensions"" tab. Then click the ""Click me to show Markdown Here options"" box.
Opera
Note that Markdown Here only works with Opera versions 16 and higher (i.e., the ones that are based on Chromium).
Go to the Opera Add-ons store page for Markdown Here and install normally.
After installing, make sure to reload your webmail or restart Chrome!
Usage Instructions
Install it, and then…


In Chrome/Safari/Opera, make sure you reload your web mail page before trying to use Markdown Here.


In Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera, log into your Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo account and start a new email. In Thunderbird, start a new message.


Make sure you're using the rich editor.

In Gmail, click the ""Rich formatting"" link, if it's visible.
In Thunderbird, make sure ""Compose messages in HTML format"" is enabled in your ""Account Settings"", ""Composition & Addressing"" pane.



Compose an email in Markdown. For example:
**Hello** `world`.

```javascript
alert('Hello syntax highlighting.');
```



Right-click in the compose box and choose the ""Markdown Toggle"" item from the context menu. Or click the button that appears in your address bar. Or use the hotkey (CTRL+ALT+M by default).


You should see your email rendered correctly from Markdown into rich HTML.


Send your awesome email to everyone you know. It will appear to them the same way it looks to you.


Revert to Markdown
After rendering your Markdown to pretty HTML, you can still get back to your original Markdown. Just right-click anywhere in the newly rendered Markdown and click ""Markdown Toggle"" -- your email compose body will change back to the Markdown you had written.
Note that any changes you make to the pretty HTML will be lost when you revert to Markdown.
In Gmail, you can also use the browser's Undo command (CTRL+Z / CMD+Z, or from the Edit menu). Be warned that you might also lose the last few characters you entered.
Replies
In Gmail, Thunderbird, and Google Groups, you can use ""Markdown Toggle"" normally: just write your reply (top, bottom, inline, wherever) and then convert. The original email that you're replying to will be left alone. (Technically: Existing blockquote blocks will be left intact.)
In Hotmail and Yahoo (which don't put the original in a blockquote), and optionally in Gmail, Thunderbird, and Google Groups, you can ensure that only the part of the reply that you wrote gets converted by selecting what you want to convert and then clicking ""Markdown Toggle"" -- see the next section.
Selection/Piecemeal Conversion
Sometimes you don't want to convert the entire email; sometimes your email isn't entirely Markdown. To convert only part of the email, select the text (with your mouse or keyboard), right-click on it, and click the ""Markdown Toggle"" menu item. Your selection is magically rendered into pretty HTML.
To revert back to Markdown, just put your cursor anywhere in the block of converted text, right click, and click the ""Markdown Toggle"" menu item again. Now it's magically back to the original Markdown.

Things to know about converting/reverting a selection


If you select only part of a block of text, only that text will be converted. The converted block will be wrapped in a paragraph element, so the original line will be broken up. You probably don't want to ever do this.


You can select and revert multiple converted blocks at the same time. One upshot of this is that you can select your entire email, click ""Markdown Toggle"", and all portions of it that you had converted will be reverted.


If you don't have anything selected when you click ""Markdown Toggle"", Markdown Here will check if there are converted blocks anywhere in the message and revert them. If there no converted blocks are found, it will convert the entire email.


Options
The Markdown Here Options page can be accessed via the Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Thunderbird extensions list. The available options include:

Styling modifications for the rendered Markdown.
Syntax highlighting theme selection and modification.
TeX math formulae processing enabling and customization.
What the hotkey should be.

For Chrome and Firefox, any changes made in the Markdown Here Options are automatically synchronized between your other installations of that browser (if you have the sync feature enabled in the browser).

Troubleshooting
See the Troubleshooting wiki page.
Compatibility
See the Compatibility wiki page.
Notes and Miscellaneous


Markdown Here uses Github Flavored Markdown, with the limitation that GFM special links are not supported (issue #11); nor will they be, as MDH is not Github-specific.


Available languages for syntax highlighting (and the way they should be written in the fenced code block) can be seen on the highlight.js demo page.


Images embedded inline in your Markdown will be retained when you ""Markdown Toggle"". Gmail allows you to put images inline in your email -- this can be much easier than referencing an external image.


Email signatures are automatically excluded from conversion. Specifically, anything after the semi-standard '-- ' (note the trailing space) is left alone.

Note that Hotmail and Yahoo do not automatically add the '-- ' to signatures, so you have to add it yourself.



The ""Markdown Toggle"" menu item shows up for more element types than it can correctly render. This is intended to help people realize that they're not using a rich editor. Otherwise they just don't see the menu item and don't know why.


Styling:

The use of browser-specific styles (-moz-, -webkit-) should be avoided. If used, they may not render correctly for people reading the email in a different browser from the one where the email was sent.
The use of state-dependent styles (like a:hover) don't work because they don't match at the time the styles are made explicit. (In email, styles must be explicitly applied to all elements -- stylesheets get stripped.)

Spring Boot  



Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and
services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform
so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need.


You can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started using
java -jar or more traditional WAR deployments. We also provide a command line tool
that runs spring scripts.


Our primary goals are:




Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all
Spring development


Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to
diverge from the defaults


Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects
(e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration)


Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration






Installation and Getting Started


The reference documentation includes detailed
installation
instructions as well as a comprehensive
getting started
guide.


Here is a quick teaser of a complete Spring Boot application in Java:



import org.springframework.boot.*;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.*;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class Example {

	@RequestMapping(""/"")
	String home() {
		return ""Hello World!"";
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Example.class, args);
	}

}





Getting help


Having trouble with Spring Boot? We’d like to help!




Check the reference documentation, especially the
How-to’s — they provide solutions to the most common
questions.


Learn the Spring basics — Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects, check
the spring.io web-site for a wealth of reference documentation. If
you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the guides.


If you are upgrading, read the release notes for upgrade instructions and
""new and noteworthy"" features.


Ask a question - we monitor stackoverflow.com for questions
tagged with spring-boot. You can also chat
with the community on Gitter.


Report bugs with Spring Boot at github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues.






Reporting Issues


Spring Boot uses GitHub’s integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature
requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:




Before you log a bug, please search the issue tracker to see if someone
has already reported the problem.


If the issue doesn’t already exist, create a new issue.


Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know
the version of Spring Boot that you are using, as well as your Operating System and
JVM version.


If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use Markdown ``` escapes
before and after your text.


If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. You can
submit sample projects as pull-requests against the
spring-boot-issues GitHub
project. Use the issue number for the name of your project.






Building from Source


You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Boot (binaries in
repo.spring.io), but if you want to try out the latest and
greatest, Spring Boot can be easily built with the
maven wrapper. You also need JDK 1.8.



$ ./mvnw clean install



If you want to build with the regular mvn command, you will need
Maven v3.5.0 or above.





Note


You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by setting
a MAVEN_OPTS environment variable with the value -Xmx512m. Remember
to set the corresponding property in your IDE as well if you are building and running
tests there (e.g. in Eclipse go to Preferences→Java→Installed JREs and edit the
JRE definition so that all processes are launched with those arguments). This property
is automatically set if you use the maven wrapper.





Also see CONTRIBUTING.adoc if you wish to submit pull requests,
and in particular please fill out the
Contributor’s Agreement
before your first change, however trivial.


Building reference documentation

First of all, make sure you have built the project:



$ ./mvnw clean install



The reference documentation requires the documentation of the Maven plugin to be
available so you need to build that first since it’s not generated by default.



$ ./mvnw clean install -pl spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin -Pdefault,full



The documentation also includes auto-generated information about the starters. You might
have that in your local repository already (per the first step) but if you want to refresh
it:



$ ./mvnw clean install -f spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters



Once this is done, you can build the reference documentation with the command below:



$ ./mvnw clean prepare-package -pl spring-boot-project/spring-boot-docs -Pdefault,full






Tip


The generated documentation is available from spring-boot-project/spring-boot-docs/target/generated-docs/reference/html








Modules


There are a number of modules in Spring Boot, here is a quick overview:


spring-boot

The main library providing features that support the other parts of Spring Boot,
these include:




The SpringApplication class, providing static convenience methods that make it easy
to write a stand-alone Spring Application. Its sole job is to create and refresh an
appropriate Spring ApplicationContext


Embedded web applications with a choice of container (Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow)


First class externalized configuration support


Convenience ApplicationContext initializers, including support for sensible logging
defaults





spring-boot-autoconfigure

Spring Boot can configure large parts of common applications based on the content
of their classpath. A single @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation triggers
auto-configuration of the Spring context.


Auto-configuration attempts to deduce which beans a user might need. For example, if
HSQLDB is on the classpath, and the user has not configured any database connections,
then they probably want an in-memory database to be defined. Auto-configuration will
always back away as the user starts to define their own beans.



spring-boot-starters

Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in
your application. You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technology
that you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy paste loads of
dependency descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and JPA for
database access just include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in your
project, and you are good to go.



spring-boot-cli

The Spring command line application compiles and runs Groovy source, making it super
easy to write the absolute minimum of code to get an application running. Spring CLI
can also watch files, automatically recompiling and restarting when they change.



spring-boot-actuator

Actuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with your application.
Spring Boot Actuator provides the infrastructure required for actuator endpoints. It contains
annotation support for actuator endpoints. Out of the box, this module provides a number of endpoints
including the HealthEndpoint, EnvironmentEndpoint, BeansEndpoint and many more.



spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure

This provides auto-configuration for actuator endpoints based on the content of the classpath and a set of properties.
For instance, if Micrometer is on the classpath, it will auto-configure the MetricsEndpoint.
It contains configuration to expose endpoints over HTTP or JMX.
Just like Spring Boot AutoConfigure, this will back away as the user starts to define their own beans.



spring-boot-test

This module contains core items and annotations that can be helpful when testing your application.



spring-boot-test-autoconfigure

Like other Spring Boot auto-configuration modules, spring-boot-test-autoconfigure, provides auto-configuration
for tests based on the classpath. It includes a number of annotations that can be used to automatically
configure a slice of your application that needs to be tested.



spring-boot-loader

Spring Boot Loader provides the secret sauce that allows you to build a single jar file
that can be launched using java -jar. Generally you will not need to use
spring-boot-loader directly, but instead work with the
Gradle or
Maven plugin.



spring-boot-devtools

The spring-boot-devtools module provides additional development-time features such as automatic restarts,
for a smoother application development experience. Developer tools are automatically disabled when
running a fully packaged application.





Samples


Groovy samples for use with the command line application are available in
spring-boot-cli/samples. To run the CLI samples type
spring run <sample>.groovy from samples directory.


Java samples are available in spring-boot-samples and should
be built with maven and run by invoking java -jar target/<sample>.jar.




Guides


The spring.io site contains several guides that show how to use Spring
Boot step-by-step:




Building an Application with Spring Boot is a
very basic guide that shows you how to create a simple application, run it and add some
management services.


Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring
Boot Actuator is a guide to creating a REST web service and also shows how the server
can be configured.


Converting a Spring Boot JAR Application
to a WAR shows you how to run applications in a web server as a WAR file.

The Algorithms - Python 

All algorithms implemented in Python (for education)
These implementations are for demonstration purposes. They are less efficient than the implementations in the Python standard library.
Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(n2)
Best case performance	O(n)
Average case performance	O(n2)

Bucket


Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(n2)
Best case performance	O(n+k)
Average case performance	O(n+k)

Source: Wikipedia
Cocktail shaker

Cocktail shaker sort, also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail sort, shaker sort (which can also refer to a variant of selection sort), ripple sort, shuffle sort, or shuttle sort, is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison sort. The algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the list.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(n2)
Best case performance	O(n)
Average case performance	O(n2)

Source: Wikipedia
Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(n2)
Best case performance	O(n)
Average case performance	O(n2)

Source: Wikipedia
View the algorithm in action
Merge Sort

Merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(n log n)
Best case performance	O(n log n)
Average case performance	O(n log n)

View the algorithm in action
Quick

Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(n2)
Best case performance	O(n log n) or O(n) with three-way partition
Average case performance	O(n log n)

Source: Wikipedia
View the algorithm in action
Heap

Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It can be thought of as an improved selection sort. It divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(n log n)
Best case performance	O(n log n)
Average case performance	O(n log n)

Source: Wikipedia

Radix
From Wikipedia: Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(wn)
Best case performance	O(wn)
Average case performance	O(wn)

Source: Wikipedia
Selection

Selection sort is an algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(n2)
Best case performance	O(n2)
Average case performance	O(n2)

Shell

Shellsort is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart.  The idea is to arrange the list of elements so that, starting anywhere, considering every nth element gives a sorted list.  Such a list is said to be h-sorted.  Equivalently, it can be thought of as h interleaved lists, each individually sorted.
Properties

Worst case performance O(nlog2n)
Best case performance O(n log n)
Average case performance depends on gap sequence

Topological
From Wikipedia: Topological sort, or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and algorithms are known for constructing a topological ordering of any DAG in linear time.
Time-Complexity Graphs
Comparing the complexity of sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort)

Comparing the sorting algorithms:
  -Quicksort is a very fast algorithm but can be pretty tricky to implement
  -Bubble sort is a slow algorithm but is very easy to implement. To sort small sets of data, bubble sort may be a better option since it can be implemented quickly, but for larger datasets, the speedup from quicksort might be worth the trouble implementing the algorithm.

Search Algorithms
Linear

Linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most n comparisons, where n is the length of the list.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(n)
Best case performance	O(1)
Average case performance	O(n)
Worst case space complexity	O(1) iterative

Source: Wikipedia
Binary

Binary search, also known as half-interval search or logarithmic search, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful.
Properties

Worst case performance	O(log n)
Best case performance	O(1)
Average case performance	O(log n)
Worst case space complexity	O(1)

Source: Wikipedia
Interpolation
Interpolation search is an algorithm for searching for a key in an array that has been ordered by numerical values assigned to the keys (key values). It was first described by W. W. Peterson in 1957. Interpolation search resembles the method by which people search a telephone directory for a name (the key value by which the book's entries are ordered): in each step the algorithm calculates where in the remaining search space the sought item might be, based on the key values at the bounds of the search space and the value of the sought key, usually via a linear interpolation. The key value actually found at this estimated position is then compared to the key value being sought. If it is not equal, then depending on the comparison, the remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position. This method will only work if calculations on the size of differences between key values are sensible.
By comparison, binary search always chooses the middle of the remaining search space, discarding one half or the other, depending on the comparison between the key found at the estimated position and the key sought — it does not require numerical values for the keys, just a total order on them. The remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position. The linear search uses equality only as it compares elements one-by-one from the start, ignoring any sorting.
On average the interpolation search makes about log(log(n)) comparisons (if the elements are uniformly distributed), where n is the number of elements to be searched. In the worst case (for instance where the numerical values of the keys increase exponentially) it can make up to O(n) comparisons.
In interpolation-sequential search, interpolation is used to find an item near the one being searched for, then linear search is used to find the exact item.
Source: Wikipedia
Jump Search
Jump search or block search refers to a search algorithm for ordered lists. It works by first checking all items Lkm, where {\displaystyle k\in \mathbb {N} } k\in \mathbb {N}  and m is the block size, until an item is found that is larger than the search key. To find the exact position of the search key in the list a linear search is performed on the sublist L[(k-1)m, km].
The optimal value of m is √n, where n is the length of the list L. Because both steps of the algorithm look at, at most, √n items the algorithm runs in O(√n) time. This is better than a linear search, but worse than a binary search. The advantage over the latter is that a jump search only needs to jump backwards once, while a binary can jump backwards up to log n times. This can be important if a jumping backwards takes significantly more time than jumping forward.
The algorithm can be modified by performing multiple levels of jump search on the sublists, before finally performing the linear search. For an k-level jump search the optimum block size ml for the lth level (counting from 1) is n(k-l)/k. The modified algorithm will perform k backward jumps and runs in O(kn1/(k+1)) time.

Quick Select

Quick Select is a selection algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an unordered list. It is related to the quicksort sorting algorithm. Like quicksort, it was developed by Tony Hoare, and thus is also known as Hoare's selection algorithm.[1] Like quicksort, it is efficient in practice and has good average-case performance, but has poor worst-case performance. Quickselect and its variants are the selection algorithms most often used in efficient real-world implementations.
Quickselect uses the same overall approach as quicksort, choosing one element as a pivot and partitioning the data in two based on the pivot, accordingly as less than or greater than the pivot. However, instead of recursing into both sides, as in quicksort, quickselect only recurses into one side – the side with the element it is searching for. This reduces the average complexity from O(n log n) to O(n), with a worst case of O(n2).
As with quicksort, quickselect is generally implemented as an in-place algorithm, and beyond selecting the k'th element, it also partially sorts the data. See selection algorithm for further discussion of the connection with sorting.

Tabu
Tabu search uses a local or neighborhood search procedure to iteratively move from one potential solution {\displaystyle x} x to an improved solution {\displaystyle x'} x' in the neighborhood of {\displaystyle x} x, until some stopping criterion has been satisfied (generally, an attempt limit or a score threshold). Local search procedures often become stuck in poor-scoring areas or areas where scores plateau. In order to avoid these pitfalls and explore regions of the search space that would be left unexplored by other local search procedures, tabu search carefully explores the neighborhood of each solution as the search progresses. The solutions admitted to the new neighborhood, {\displaystyle N^{}(x)} N^(x), are determined through the use of memory structures. Using these memory structures, the search progresses by iteratively moving from the current solution {\displaystyle x} x to an improved solution {\displaystyle x'} x' in {\displaystyle N^{}(x)} N^(x).
These memory structures form what is known as the tabu list, a set of rules and banned solutions used to filter which solutions will be admitted to the neighborhood {\displaystyle N^{}(x)} N^(x) to be explored by the search. In its simplest form, a tabu list is a short-term set of the solutions that have been visited in the recent past (less than {\displaystyle n} n iterations ago, where {\displaystyle n} n is the number of previous solutions to be stored — is also called the tabu tenure). More commonly, a tabu list consists of solutions that have changed by the process of moving from one solution to another. It is convenient, for ease of description, to understand a “solution” to be coded and represented by such attributes.

Ciphers
Caesar
![alt text][caesar]
Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communication security.
Source: Wikipedia
Vigenère
Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a form of polyalphabetic substitution.
The Vigenère cipher has been reinvented many times. The method was originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso; however, the scheme was later misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère in the 19th century, and is now widely known as the ""Vigenère cipher"".
Though the cipher is easy to understand and implement, for three centuries it resisted all attempts to break it; this earned it the description le chiffre indéchiffrable(French for 'the indecipherable cipher').
Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers. Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering a Vigenère cipher in 1863.
Source: Wikipedia
Transposition
Transposition cipher is a method of encryption by which the positions held by units of plaintext (which are commonly characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular system, so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext. That is, the order of the units is changed (the plaintext is reordered).
Mathematically a bijective function is used on the characters' positions to encrypt and an inverse function to decrypt.
Source: Wikipedia
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret (private). In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers, the ""factoring problem"". The acronym RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described the algorithm in 1978. Clifford Cocks, an English mathematician working for the British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), had developed an equivalent system in 1973, but this was not declassified until 1997.[1]
A user of RSA creates and then publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but with currently published methods, and if the public key is large enough, only someone with knowledge of the prime numbers can decode the message feasibly.[2] Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem. Whether it is as difficult as the factoring problem remains an open question.
Source: Wikipedia
ROT13

ROT13 (""rotate by 13 places"", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome.
Because there are 26 letters (2×13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.[1]
Source: Wikipedia
XOR
XOR cipher is a simple type of additive cipher,[1] an encryption algorithm that operates according to the principles:
A {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  0 = A,
A {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  A = 0,
(A {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  B) {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  C = A {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  (B {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  C),
(B {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  A) {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  A = B {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  0 = B,
where {\displaystyle \oplus } \oplus  denotes the exclusive disjunction (XOR) operation. This operation is sometimes called modulus 2 addition (or subtraction, which is identical).[2] With this logic, a string of text can be encrypted by applying the bitwise XOR operator to every character using a given key. To decrypt the output, merely reapplying the XOR function with the key will remove the cipher.

  ""scripts"": {
    ""dev"": ""next"",
    ""build"": ""next build"",
    ""start"": ""next start""
  }
}
After that, the file-system is the main API. Every .js file becomes a route that gets automatically processed and rendered.
Populate ./pages/index.js inside your project:
function Home() {
  return <div>Welcome to Next.js!</div>
}

export default Home
and then just run npm run dev and go to http://localhost:3000. To use another port, you can run npm run dev -- -p <your port here>.
So far, we get:

Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
Hot code reloading
Server rendering and indexing of ./pages
Static file serving. ./static/ is mapped to /static/ (given you create a ./static/ directory inside your project)

Automatic code splitting
Every import you declare gets bundled and served with each page. That means pages never load unnecessary code!
import cowsay from 'cowsay-browser'

function CowsayHi() {
  return <pre>{cowsay.say({ text: 'hi there!' })}</pre>
}

export default CowsayHi
CSS
Built-in CSS support

Examples

Basic css


We bundle styled-jsx to provide support for isolated scoped CSS. The aim is to support ""shadow CSS"" similar to Web Components, which unfortunately do not support server-rendering and are JS-only.
function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello world
      <p>scoped!</p>
      <style jsx>{`
        p {
          color: blue;
        }
        div {
          background: red;
        }
        @media (max-width: 600px) {
          div {
            background: blue;
          }
        }
      `}</style>
      <style global jsx>{`
        body {
          background: black;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
}

export default HelloWorld
Please see the styled-jsx documentation for more examples.
CSS-in-JS


Examples


Styled components
Styletron
Glamor
Cxs
Aphrodite
Fela


It's possible to use any existing CSS-in-JS solution. The simplest one is inline styles:
function HiThere() {
  return <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>hi there</p>
}

export default HiThere
To use more sophisticated CSS-in-JS solutions, you typically have to implement style flushing for server-side rendering. We enable this by allowing you to define your own custom <Document> component that wraps each page.
Importing CSS / Sass / Less / Stylus files
To support importing .css, .scss, .less or .styl files you can use these modules, which configure sensible defaults for server rendered applications.

@zeit/next-css
@zeit/next-sass
@zeit/next-less
@zeit/next-stylus

Static file serving (e.g.: images)

Examples

Public file serving


Create a folder called static in your project root directory. From your code you can then reference those files with /static/ URLs:
function MyImage() {
  return <img src=""/static/my-image.png"" alt=""my image"" />
}

export default MyImage
To serve static files from the root directory you can add a folder called public and reference those files from the root, e.g: /robots.txt
Note: Don't name the static or public directory anything else. The names can't be changed and are the only directories that Next.js uses for serving static assets
Populating <head>

Examples

Head elements
Layout component


We expose a built-in component for appending elements to the <head> of the page.
import Head from 'next/head'

function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My page title</title>
        <meta name=""viewport"" content=""initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width"" />
      </Head>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default IndexPage
To avoid duplicate tags in your <head> you can use the key property, which will make sure the tag is only rendered once:
import Head from 'next/head'

function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>My page title</title>
        <meta
          name=""viewport""
          content=""initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width""
          key=""viewport""
        />
      </Head>
      <Head>
        <meta
          name=""viewport""
          content=""initial-scale=1.2, width=device-width""
          key=""viewport""
        />
      </Head>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default IndexPage
In this case only the second <meta name=""viewport"" /> is rendered.
Note: The contents of <head> get cleared upon unmounting the component, so make sure each page completely defines what it needs in <head>, without making assumptions about what other pages added.
Note: <title> and <meta> elements need to be contained as direct children of the <Head> element, or wrapped into maximum one level of <React.Fragment>, otherwise the metatags won't be correctly picked up on clientside navigation.
Fetching data and component lifecycle

Examples

Data fetch


When you need state, lifecycle hooks or initial data population you can export a React.Component (instead of a stateless function, like shown above):
import React from 'react'

class HelloUA extends React.Component {
  static async getInitialProps({ req }) {
    const userAgent = req ? req.headers['user-agent'] : navigator.userAgent
    return { userAgent }
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Hello World {this.props.userAgent}</div>
  }
}

export default HelloUA
Notice that to load data when the page loads, we use getInitialProps which is an async static method. It can asynchronously fetch anything that resolves to a JavaScript plain Object, which populates props.
Data returned from getInitialProps is serialized when server rendering, similar to a JSON.stringify. Make sure the returned object from getInitialProps is a plain Object and not using Date, Map or Set.
For the initial page load, getInitialProps will execute on the server only. getInitialProps will only be executed on the client when navigating to a different route via the Link component or using the routing APIs.
Note: getInitialProps can not be used in children components. Only in pages.


If you are using some server only modules inside getInitialProps, make sure to import them properly.
Otherwise, it'll slow down your app.


You can also define the getInitialProps lifecycle method for stateless components:
function Page({ stars }) {
  return <div>Next stars: {stars}</div>
}

Page.getInitialProps = async ({ req }) => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/zeit/next.js')
  const json = await res.json()
  return { stars: json.stargazers_count }
}

export default Page
getInitialProps receives a context object with the following properties:

pathname - path section of URL
query - query string section of URL parsed as an object
asPath - String of the actual path (including the query) shows in the browser
req - HTTP request object (server only)
res - HTTP response object (server only)
err - Error object if any error is encountered during the rendering

Routing
Next.js does not ship a routes manifest with every possible route in the application, so the current page is not aware of any other pages on the client side. All subsequent routes get lazy-loaded, for scalability sake.
With <Link>

Examples

Hello World


Client-side transitions between routes can be enabled via a <Link> component.
Basic Example
Consider these two pages:
// pages/index.js
import Link from 'next/link'

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      Click{' '}
      <Link href=""/about"">
        <a>here</a>
      </Link>{' '}
      to read more
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
// pages/about.js
function About() {
  return <p>Welcome to About!</p>
}

export default About
Custom routes (using props from URL)
<Link> component has two main props:

href: the path inside pages directory + query string.
as: the path that will be rendered in the browser URL bar.

Example:


Consider you have the URL /post/:slug.


You created the pages/post.js
class Post extends React.Component {
  static async getInitialProps({ query }) {
    console.log('SLUG', query.slug)
    return {}
  }
  render() {
    return <h1>My blog post</h1>
  }
}

export default Post


You add the route to express (or any other server) on server.js file (this is only for SSR). This will route the url /post/:slug to pages/post.js and provide slug as part of query in getInitialProps.
server.get('/post/:slug', (req, res) => {
  return app.render(req, res, '/post', { slug: req.params.slug })
})


For client side routing, use next/link:
<Link href=""/post?slug=something"" as=""/post/something"">


Note: use <Link prefetch> for maximum performance, to link and prefetch in the background at the same time
Client-side routing behaves exactly like the browser:

The component is fetched
If it defines getInitialProps, data is fetched. If an error occurs, _error.js is rendered
After 1 and 2 complete, pushState is performed and the new component is rendered

To inject the pathname, query or asPath in your component, you can use withRouter.
With URL object

Examples

With URL Object Routing


The component <Link> can also receive a URL object and it will automatically format it to create the URL string.
// pages/index.js
import Link from 'next/link'

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      Click{' '}
      <Link href={{ pathname: '/about', query: { name: 'Zeit' } }}>
        <a>here</a>
      </Link>{' '}
      to read more
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
That will generate the URL string /about?name=Zeit, you can use every property as defined in the Node.js URL module documentation.
Replace instead of push url
The default behaviour for the <Link> component is to push a new url into the stack. You can use the replace prop to prevent adding a new entry.
// pages/index.js
import Link from 'next/link'

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      Click{' '}
      <Link href=""/about"" replace>
        <a>here</a>
      </Link>{' '}
      to read more
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
Using a component that supports onClick
<Link> supports any component that supports the onClick event. In case you don't provide an <a> tag, it will only add the onClick event handler and won't pass the href property.
// pages/index.js
import Link from 'next/link'

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      Click{' '}
      <Link href=""/about"">
        <img src=""/static/image.png"" alt=""image"" />
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
Forcing the Link to expose href to its child
If child is an <a> tag and doesn't have a href attribute we specify it so that the repetition is not needed by the user. However, sometimes, you’ll want to pass an <a> tag inside of a wrapper and the Link won’t recognize it as a hyperlink, and, consequently, won’t transfer its href to the child. In cases like that, you should define a boolean passHref property to the Link, forcing it to expose its href property to the child.
Please note: using a tag other than a and failing to pass passHref may result in links that appear to navigate correctly, but, when being crawled by search engines, will not be recognized as links (owing to the lack of href attribute). This may result in negative effects on your sites SEO.
import Link from 'next/link'
import Unexpected_A from 'third-library'

function NavLink({ href, name }) {
  return (
    <Link href={href} passHref>
      <Unexpected_A>{name}</Unexpected_A>
    </Link>
  )
}

export default NavLink
Disabling the scroll changes to top on page
The default behaviour of <Link> is to scroll to the top of the page. When there is a hash defined it will scroll to the specific id, just like a normal <a> tag. To prevent scrolling to the top / hash scroll={false} can be added to <Link>:
<Link scroll={false} href=""/?counter=10""><a>Disables scrolling</a></Link>
<Link href=""/?counter=10""><a>Changes with scrolling to top</a></Link>
Imperatively

Examples

Basic routing
With a page loading indicator


You can also do client-side page transitions using the next/router
import Router from 'next/router'

function ReadMore() {
  return (
    <div>
      Click <span onClick={() => Router.push('/about')}>here</span> to read more
    </div>
  )
}

export default ReadMore
Intercepting popstate
In some cases (for example, if using a custom router), you may wish
to listen to popstate and react before the router acts on it.
For example, you could use this to manipulate the request, or force an SSR refresh.
import Router from 'next/router'

Router.beforePopState(({ url, as, options }) => {
  // I only want to allow these two routes!
  if (as !== '/' || as !== '/other') {
    // Have SSR render bad routes as a 404.
    window.location.href = as
    return false
  }

  return true
})
If the function you pass into beforePopState returns false, Router will not handle popstate;
you'll be responsible for handling it, in that case.
See Disabling File-System Routing.
Above Router object comes with the following API:

route - String of the current route
pathname - String of the current path excluding the query string
query - Object with the parsed query string. Defaults to {}
asPath - String of the actual path (including the query) shows in the browser
push(url, as=url) - performs a pushState call with the given url
replace(url, as=url) - performs a replaceState call with the given url
beforePopState(cb=function) - intercept popstate before router processes the event.

The second as parameter for push and replace is an optional decoration of the URL. Useful if you configured custom routes on the server.
With URL object
You can use a URL object the same way you use it in a <Link> component to push and replace a URL.
import Router from 'next/router'

const handler = () => {
  Router.push({
    pathname: '/about',
    query: { name: 'Zeit' }
  })
}

function ReadMore() {
  return (
    <div>
      Click <span onClick={handler}>here</span> to read more
    </div>
  )
}

export default ReadMore
This uses the same exact parameters as in the <Link> component.
Router Events
You can also listen to different events happening inside the Router.
Here's a list of supported events:

routeChangeStart(url) - Fires when a route starts to change
routeChangeComplete(url) - Fires when a route changed completely
routeChangeError(err, url) - Fires when there's an error when changing routes
beforeHistoryChange(url) - Fires just before changing the browser's history
hashChangeStart(url) - Fires when the hash will change but not the page
hashChangeComplete(url) - Fires when the hash has changed but not the page


Here url is the URL shown in the browser. If you call Router.push(url, as) (or similar), then the value of url will be as.

Here's how to properly listen to the router event routeChangeStart:
const handleRouteChange = url => {
  console.log('App is changing to: ', url)
}

Router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)
If you no longer want to listen to that event, you can unsubscribe with the off method:
Router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)
If a route load is cancelled (for example by clicking two links rapidly in succession), routeChangeError will fire. The passed err will contain a cancelled property set to true.
Router.events.on('routeChangeError', (err, url) => {
  if (err.cancelled) {
    console.log(`Route to ${url} was cancelled!`)
  }
})
Shallow Routing

Examples

Shallow Routing


Shallow routing allows you to change the URL without running getInitialProps. You'll receive the updated pathname and the query via the router prop (injected using withRouter), without losing state.
You can do this by invoking either Router.push or Router.replace with the shallow: true option. Here's an example:
// Current URL is ""/""
const href = '/?counter=10'
const as = href
Router.push(href, as, { shallow: true })
Now, the URL is updated to /?counter=10. You can see the updated URL with this.props.router.query inside the Component (make sure you are using withRouter around your Component to inject the router prop).
You can watch for URL changes via componentDidUpdate hook as shown below:
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
  const { pathname, query } = this.props.router
  // verify props have changed to avoid an infinite loop
  if (query.id !== prevProps.router.query.id) {
    // fetch data based on the new query
  }
}

NOTES:
Shallow routing works only for same page URL changes. For an example, let's assume we have another page called about, and you run this:
Router.push('/?counter=10', '/about?counter=10', { shallow: true })
Since that's a new page, it'll unload the current page, load the new one and call getInitialProps even though we asked to do shallow routing.

Using a Higher Order Component

Examples

Using the `withRouter` utility


If you want to access the router object inside any component in your app, you can use the withRouter Higher-Order Component. Here's how to use it:
import { withRouter } from 'next/router'

function ActiveLink({ children, router, href }) {
  const style = {
    marginRight: 10,
    color: router.pathname === href ? 'red' : 'black'
  }

  const handleClick = e => {
    e.preventDefault()
    router.push(href)
  }

  return (
    <a href={href} onClick={handleClick} style={style}>
      {children}
    </a>
  )
}

export default withRouter(ActiveLink)
The above router object comes with an API similar to next/router.
Prefetching Pages
⚠️ This is a production only feature ⚠️

Examples

Prefetching


Next.js has an API which allows you to prefetch pages.
Since Next.js server-renders your pages, this allows all the future interaction paths of your app to be instant. Effectively Next.js gives you the great initial download performance of a website, with the ahead-of-time download capabilities of an app. Read more.

With prefetching Next.js only downloads JS code. When the page is getting rendered, you may need to wait for the data.


<link rel=""preload""> is used for prefetching. Sometimes browsers will show a warning if the resource is not used within 3 seconds, these warnings can be ignored as per https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/6517#issuecomment-469063892

With <Link>
You can add prefetch prop to any <Link> and Next.js will prefetch those pages in the background.
import Link from 'next/link'

function Header() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link prefetch href=""/"">
            <a>Home</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link prefetch href=""/about"">
            <a>About</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link prefetch href=""/contact"">
            <a>Contact</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  )
}

export default Header
Imperatively
Most prefetching needs are addressed by <Link />, but we also expose an imperative API for advanced usage:
import { withRouter } from 'next/router'

function MyLink({ router }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <a onClick={() => setTimeout(() => router.push('/dynamic'), 100)}>
        A route transition will happen after 100ms
      </a>
      {// but we can prefetch it!
      router.prefetch('/dynamic')}
    </div>
  )
}

export default withRouter(MyLink)
The router instance should be only used inside the client side of your app though. In order to prevent any error regarding this subject, when rendering the Router on the server side, use the imperatively prefetch method in the componentDidMount() lifecycle method.
import React from 'react'
import { withRouter } from 'next/router'

class MyLink extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    const { router } = this.props
    router.prefetch('/dynamic')
  }

  render() {
    const { router } = this.props

    return (
      <div>
        <a onClick={() => setTimeout(() => router.push('/dynamic'), 100)}>
          A route transition will happen after 100ms
        </a>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default withRouter(MyLink)
Custom server and routing

Examples

Basic custom server
Express integration
Hapi integration
Koa integration
Parameterized routing
SSR caching


Typically you start your next server with next start. It's possible, however, to start a server 100% programmatically in order to customize routes, use route patterns, etc.
When using a custom server with a server file, for example called server.js, make sure you update the scripts key in package.json to:
{
  ""scripts"": {
    ""dev"": ""node server.js"",
    ""build"": ""next build"",
    ""start"": ""NODE_ENV=production node server.js""
  }
}
This example makes /a resolve to ./pages/b, and /b resolve to ./pages/a:
// This file doesn't go through babel or webpack transformation.
// Make sure the syntax and sources this file requires are compatible with the current node version you are running
// See https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/1245 for discussions on Universal Webpack or universal Babel
const { createServer } = require('http')
const { parse } = require('url')
const next = require('next')

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
const app = next({ dev })
const handle = app.getRequestHandler()

app.prepare().then(() => {
  createServer((req, res) => {
    // Be sure to pass `true` as the second argument to `url.parse`.
    // This tells it to parse the query portion of the URL.
    const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true)
    const { pathname, query } = parsedUrl

    if (pathname === '/a') {
      app.render(req, res, '/b', query)
    } else if (pathname === '/b') {
      app.render(req, res, '/a', query)
    } else {
      handle(req, res, parsedUrl)
    }
  }).listen(3000, err => {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log('> Ready on http://localhost:3000')
  })
})
The next API is as follows:

next(opts: object)

Supported options:

dev (bool) whether to launch Next.js in dev mode - default false
dir (string) where the Next project is located - default '.'
quiet (bool) Hide error messages containing server information - default false
conf (object) the same object you would use in next.config.js - default {}

Then, change your start script to NODE_ENV=production node server.js.
Disabling file-system routing
By default, Next will serve each file in /pages under a pathname matching the filename (eg, /pages/some-file.js is served at site.com/some-file.
If your project uses custom routing, this behavior may result in the same content being served from multiple paths, which can present problems with SEO and UX.
To disable this behavior & prevent routing based on files in /pages, simply set the following option in your next.config.js:
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  useFileSystemPublicRoutes: false
}
Note that useFileSystemPublicRoutes simply disables filename routes from SSR; client-side routing
may still access those paths. If using this option, you should guard against navigation to routes
you do not want programmatically.
You may also wish to configure the client-side Router to disallow client-side redirects to filename
routes; please refer to Intercepting popstate.
Dynamic assetPrefix
Sometimes we need to set the assetPrefix dynamically. This is useful when changing the assetPrefix based on incoming requests.
For that, we can use app.setAssetPrefix.
Here's an example usage of it:
const next = require('next')
const http = require('http')

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
const app = next({ dev })
const handleNextRequests = app.getRequestHandler()

app.prepare().then(() => {
  const server = new http.Server((req, res) => {
    // Add assetPrefix support based on the hostname
    if (req.headers.host === 'my-app.com') {
      app.setAssetPrefix('http://cdn.com/myapp')
    } else {
      app.setAssetPrefix('')
    }

    handleNextRequests(req, res)
  })

  server.listen(port, err => {
    if (err) {
      throw err
    }

    console.log(`> Ready on http://localhost:${port}`)
  })
})
Dynamic Import

Examples

With Dynamic Import


Next.js supports TC39 dynamic import proposal for JavaScript.
With that, you could import JavaScript modules (inc. React Components) dynamically and work with them.
You can think dynamic imports as another way to split your code into manageable chunks.
Since Next.js supports dynamic imports with SSR, you could do amazing things with it.
Here are a few ways to use dynamic imports.
Basic Usage (Also does SSR)
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/hello'))

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponent />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
With named exports
// components/hello.js
export function Hello() {
  return <p>Hello!</p>
}
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() =>
  import('../components/hello').then(mod => mod.Hello)
)

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponent />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
With Custom Loading Component
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading = dynamic(
  () => import('../components/hello2'),
  {
    loading: () => <p>...</p>
  }
)

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
With No SSR
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const DynamicComponentWithNoSSR = dynamic(
  () => import('../components/hello3'),
  {
    ssr: false
  }
)

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <DynamicComponentWithNoSSR />
      <p>HOME PAGE is here!</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
With Multiple Modules At Once
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HelloBundle = dynamic({
  modules: () => {
    const components = {
      Hello1: () => import('../components/hello1'),
      Hello2: () => import('../components/hello2')
    }

    return components
  },
  render: (props, { Hello1, Hello2 }) => (

      <Hello2 />
    </div>
  )
})

export default DynamicBundle
Custom <App>

Examples

Using `_app.js` for layout
Using `_app.js` to override `componentDidCatch`


Next.js uses the App component to initialize pages. You can override it and control the page initialization. Which allows you to do amazing things like:

Persisting layout between page changes
Keeping state when navigating pages
Custom error handling using componentDidCatch
Inject additional data into pages (for example by processing GraphQL queries)

To override, create the ./pages/_app.js file and override the App class as shown below:
import React from 'react'
import App, { Container } from 'next/app'

class MyApp extends App {
  static async getInitialProps({ Component, ctx }) {
    let pageProps = {}

    if (Component.getInitialProps) {
      pageProps = await Component.getInitialProps(ctx)
    }

    return { pageProps }
  }

  render() {
    const { Component, pageProps } = this.props

    return (
      <Container>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Container>
    )
  }
}

export default MyApp
Custom <Document>

Examples

Styled components custom document
Google AMP



Is rendered on the server side
Is used to change the initial server side rendered document markup
Commonly used to implement server side rendering for css-in-js libraries like styled-components or emotion. styled-jsx is included with Next.js by default.

Pages in Next.js skip the definition of the surrounding document's markup. For example, you never include <html>, <body>, etc. To override that default behavior, you must create a file at ./pages/_document.js, where you can extend the Document class:
// _document is only rendered on the server side and not on the client side
// Event handlers like onClick can't be added to this file

// ./pages/_document.js
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'

class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)
    return { ...initialProps }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
          <style>{`body { margin: 0 } /* custom! */`}</style>
        </Head>
        <body className=""custom_class"">
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}

export default MyDocument
All of <Head />, <Main /> and <NextScript /> are required for page to be properly rendered.
Note: React-components outside of <Main /> will not be initialised by the browser. Do not add application logic here. If you need shared components in all your pages (like a menu or a toolbar), take a look at the App component instead.
The ctx object is equivalent to the one received in all getInitialProps hooks, with one addition:

renderPage (Function) a callback that executes the actual React rendering logic (synchronously). It's useful to decorate this function in order to support server-rendering wrappers like Aphrodite's renderStatic

Customizing renderPage
🚧 It should be noted that the only reason you should be customizing renderPage is for usage with css-in-js libraries
that need to wrap the application to properly work with server-rendering. 🚧

It takes as argument an options object for further customization

import Document from 'next/document'

class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage

    ctx.renderPage = () =>
      originalRenderPage({
        // useful for wrapping the whole react tree
        enhanceApp: App => App,
        // useful for wrapping in a per-page basis
        enhanceComponent: Component => Component
      })

    // Run the parent `getInitialProps` using `ctx` that now includes our custom `renderPage`
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)

    return initialProps
  }
}

export default MyDocument
Custom error handling
404 or 500 errors are handled both client and server side by a default component error.js. If you wish to override it, define a _error.js in the pages folder:
⚠️ The pages/_error.js component is only used in production. In development you get an error with call stack to know where the error originated from. ⚠️
import React from 'react'

class Error extends React.Component {
  static getInitialProps({ res, err }) {
    const statusCode = res ? res.statusCode : err ? err.statusCode : null
    return { statusCode }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <p>
        {this.props.statusCode
          ? `An error ${this.props.statusCode} occurred on server`
          : 'An error occurred on client'}
      </p>
    )
  }
}

export default Error
Reusing the built-in error page
If you want to render the built-in error page you can by using next/error:
import React from 'react'
import Error from 'next/error'
import fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch'

class Page extends React.Component {
  static async getInitialProps() {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/zeit/next.js')
    const errorCode = res.statusCode > 200 ? res.statusCode : false
    const json = await res.json()

    return { errorCode, stars: json.stargazers_count }
  }

  render() {
    if (this.props.errorCode) {
      return <Error statusCode={this.props.errorCode} />
    }

    return <div>Next stars: {this.props.stars}</div>
  }
}

export default Page

If you have created a custom error page you have to import your own _error component from ./_error instead of next/error

Custom configuration
For custom advanced behavior of Next.js, you can create a next.config.js in the root of your project directory (next to pages/ and package.json).
Note: next.config.js is a regular Node.js module, not a JSON file. It gets used by the Next server and build phases, and not included in the browser build.
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  /* config options here */
}
Or use a function:
module.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
  return {
    /* config options here */
  }
}
phase is the current context in which the configuration is loaded. You can see all phases here: constants
Phases can be imported from next/constants:
const { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } = require('next/constants')
module.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
  if (phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {
    return {
      /* development only config options here */
    }
  }

  return {
    /* config options for all phases except development here */
  }
}
Setting a custom build directory
You can specify a name to use for a custom build directory. For example, the following config will create a build folder instead of a .next folder. If no configuration is specified then next will create a .next folder.
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  distDir: 'build'
}
Disabling etag generation
You can disable etag generation for HTML pages depending on your cache strategy. If no configuration is specified then Next will generate etags for every page.
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  generateEtags: false
}
Configuring the onDemandEntries
Next exposes some options that give you some control over how the server will dispose or keep in memories pages built:
module.exports = {
  onDemandEntries: {
    // period (in ms) where the server will keep pages in the buffer
    maxInactiveAge: 25 * 1000,
    // number of pages that should be kept simultaneously without being disposed
    pagesBufferLength: 2
  }
}
This is development-only feature. If you want to cache SSR pages in production, please see SSR-caching example.
Configuring extensions looked for when resolving pages in pages
Aimed at modules like @zeit/next-mdx, that add support for pages ending with .mdx. pageExtensions allows you to configure the extensions looked for in the pages directory when resolving pages.
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  pageExtensions: ['mdx', 'jsx', 'js']
}
Configuring the build ID
Next.js uses a constant generated at build time to identify which version of your application is being served. This can cause problems in multi-server deployments when next build is ran on every server. In order to keep a static build id between builds you can provide the generateBuildId function:
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  generateBuildId: async () => {
    // For example get the latest git commit hash here
    return 'my-build-id'
  }
}
To fall back to the default of generating a unique id return null from the function:
module.exports = {
  generateBuildId: async () => {
    // When process.env.YOUR_BUILD_ID is undefined we fall back to the default
    if (process.env.YOUR_BUILD_ID) {
      return process.env.YOUR_BUILD_ID
    }

    return null
  }
}
Configuring next process script
You can pass any node arguments to next CLI command.
NODE_OPTIONS=""--throw-deprecation"" next
NODE_OPTIONS=""-r esm"" next
NODE_OPTIONS=""--inspect"" next
Customizing webpack config

Examples

Custom webpack bundle analyzer


Some commonly asked for features are available as modules:

@zeit/next-css
@zeit/next-sass
@zeit/next-less
@zeit/next-preact
@zeit/next-mdx


Warning: The webpack function is executed twice, once for the server and once for the client. This allows you to distinguish between client and server configuration using the isServer property

Multiple configurations can be combined together with function composition. For example:
const withMDX = require('@zeit/next-mdx')
const withSass = require('@zeit/next-sass')

module.exports = withMDX(
  withSass({
    webpack(config, options) {
      // Further custom configuration here
      return config
    }
  })
)
In order to extend our usage of webpack, you can define a function that extends its config via next.config.js.
// next.config.js is not transformed by Babel. So you can only use javascript features supported by your version of Node.js.

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    // Note: we provide webpack above so you should not `require` it
    // Perform customizations to webpack config
    // Important: return the modified config

    // Example using webpack option
    config.plugins.push(
      new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/\/__tests__\//),
    )
    return config
  },
  webpackDevMiddleware: config => {
    // Perform customizations to webpack dev middleware config
    // Important: return the modified config
    return config
  }
}
The second argument to webpack is an object containing properties useful when customizing its configuration:

buildId - String the build id used as a unique identifier between builds
dev - Boolean shows if the compilation is done in development mode
isServer - Boolean shows if the resulting configuration will be used for server side (true), or client size compilation (false).
defaultLoaders - Object Holds loader objects Next.js uses internally, so that you can use them in custom configuration

babel - Object the babel-loader configuration for Next.js.
hotSelfAccept - Object the hot-self-accept-loader configuration. This loader should only be used for advanced use cases. For example @zeit/next-typescript adds it for top-level typescript pages.



Example usage of defaultLoaders.babel:
// Example next.config.js for adding a loader that depends on babel-loader
// This source was taken from the @zeit/next-mdx plugin source:
// https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/blob/master/packages/next-mdx
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, options) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.mdx/,
      use: [
        options.defaultLoaders.babel,
        {
          loader: '@mdx-js/loader',
          options: pluginOptions.options
        }
      ]
    })

    return config
  }
}
Customizing babel config

Examples

Custom babel configuration


In order to extend our usage of babel, you can simply define a .babelrc file at the root of your app. This file is optional.
If found, we're going to consider it the source of truth, therefore it needs to define what next needs as well, which is the next/babel preset.
This is designed so that you are not surprised by modifications we could make to the babel configurations.
Here's an example .babelrc file:
{
  ""presets"": [""next/babel""],
  ""plugins"": []
}
The next/babel preset includes everything needed to transpile React applications. This includes:

preset-env
preset-react
plugin-proposal-class-properties
plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread
plugin-transform-runtime
styled-jsx

These presets / plugins should not be added to your custom .babelrc. Instead, you can configure them on the next/babel preset:
{
  ""presets"": [
    [
      ""next/babel"",
      {
        ""preset-env"": {},
        ""transform-runtime"": {},
        ""styled-jsx"": {},
        ""class-properties"": {}
      }
    ]
  ],
  ""plugins"": []
}
The modules option on ""preset-env"" should be kept to false otherwise webpack code splitting is disabled.
Exposing configuration to the server / client side
There is a common need in applications to provide configuration values.
Next.js supports 2 ways of providing configuration:

Build-time configuration
Runtime configuration

Build time configuration
The way build-time configuration works is by inlining the provided values into the Javascript bundle.
You can add the env key in next.config.js:
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  env: {
    customKey: 'value'
  }
}
This will allow you to use process.env.customKey in your code. For example:
// pages/index.js
function Index() {
  return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>
}

export default Index

Warning: Note that it is not possible to destructure process.env variables due to the webpack DefinePlugin replacing process.env.XXXX inline at build time

// Will not work
const { CUSTOM_KEY, CUSTOM_SECRET } = process.env;
AuthMethod({ key: CUSTOM_KEY, secret: CUSTOM_SECRET });

// Will work as replaced inline
AuthMethod({ key: process.env.CUSTOM_KEY, secret: process.env.CUSTOM_SECRET });
Runtime configuration

Warning: Note that this option is not available when using target: 'serverless'


Warning: Generally you want to use build-time configuration to provide your configuration.
The reason for this is that runtime configuration adds a small rendering / initialization overhead.

The next/config module gives your app access to the publicRuntimeConfig and serverRuntimeConfig stored in your next.config.js.
Place any server-only runtime config under a serverRuntimeConfig property.
Anything accessible to both client and server-side code should be under publicRuntimeConfig.
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  serverRuntimeConfig: {
    // Will only be available on the server side
    mySecret: 'secret',
    secondSecret: process.env.SECOND_SECRET // Pass through env variables
  },
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    // Will be available on both server and client
    staticFolder: '/static'
  }
}
// pages/index.js
import getConfig from 'next/config'
// Only holds serverRuntimeConfig and publicRuntimeConfig from next.config.js nothing else.
const { serverRuntimeConfig, publicRuntimeConfig } = getConfig()

console.log(serverRuntimeConfig.mySecret) // Will only be available on the server side
console.log(publicRuntimeConfig.staticFolder) // Will be available on both server and client

function MyImage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={`${publicRuntimeConfig.staticFolder}/logo.png`} alt=""logo"" />
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyImage
Starting the server on alternative hostname
To start the development server using a different default hostname you can use --hostname hostname_here or -H hostname_here option with next dev. This will start a TCP server listening for connections on the provided host.
CDN support with Asset Prefix
To set up a CDN, you can set up the assetPrefix setting and configure your CDN's origin to resolve to the domain that Next.js is hosted on.
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
module.exports = {
  // You may only need to add assetPrefix in the production.
  assetPrefix: isProd ? 'https://cdn.mydomain.com' : ''
}
Note: Next.js will automatically use that prefix in the scripts it loads, but this has no effect whatsoever on /static or /public. If you want to serve those assets over the CDN, you'll have to introduce the prefix yourself. One way of introducing a prefix that works inside your components and varies by environment is documented in this example.
If your CDN is on a separate domain and you would like assets to be requested using a CORS aware request you can set a config option for that.
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  crossOrigin: 'anonymous'
}
Production deployment
To deploy, instead of running next, you want to build for production usage ahead of time. Therefore, building and starting are separate commands:
next build
next start
To deploy Next.js with ZEIT Now see the ZEIT Guide for Deploying Next.js with Now.
Next.js can be deployed to other hosting solutions too. Please have a look at the 'Deployment' section of the wiki.
Note: NODE_ENV is properly configured by the next subcommands, if absent, to maximize performance. if you’re using Next.js programmatically, it’s your responsibility to set NODE_ENV=production manually!
Note: we recommend putting .next, or your custom dist folder, in .gitignore or .npmignore. Otherwise, use files or now.files to opt-into a whitelist of files you want to deploy, excluding .next or your custom dist folder.
Serverless deployment

Examples

now.sh
anna-artemov.now.sh
We encourage contributing more examples to this section


Serverless deployment dramatically improves reliability and scalability by splitting your application into smaller parts (also called lambdas). In the case of Next.js, each page in the pages directory becomes a serverless lambda.
There are a number of benefits to serverless. The referenced link talks about some of them in the context of Express, but the principles apply universally: serverless allows for distributed points of failure, infinite scalability, and is incredibly affordable with a ""pay for what you use"" model.
To enable serverless mode in Next.js, add the serverless build target in next.config.js:
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless'
}
The serverless target will output a single lambda per page. This file is completely standalone and doesn't require any dependencies to run:

pages/index.js => .next/serverless/pages/index.js
pages/about.js => .next/serverless/pages/about.js

The signature of the Next.js Serverless function is similar to the Node.js HTTP server callback:
export function render(req: http.IncomingMessage, res: http.ServerResponse) => void

http.IncomingMessage
http.ServerResponse
void refers to the function not having a return value and is equivalent to JavaScript's undefined. Calling the function will finish the request.

Using the serverless target, you can deploy Next.js to ZEIT Now with all of the benefits and added ease of control like for example; custom routes and caching headers. See the ZEIT Guide for Deploying Next.js with Now for more information.
One Level Lower
Next.js provides low-level APIs for serverless deployments as hosting platforms have different function signatures. In general you will want to wrap the output of a Next.js serverless build with a compatibility layer.
For example if the platform supports the Node.js http.Server class:
const http = require('http')
const page = require('./.next/serverless/pages/about.js')
const server = new http.Server((req, res) => page.render(req, res))
server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Listening on http://localhost:3000'))
For specific platform examples see the examples section above.
Summary

Low-level API for implementing serverless deployment
Every page in the pages directory becomes a serverless function (lambda)
Creates the smallest possible serverless function (50Kb base zip size)
Optimized for fast cold start of the function
The serverless function has 0 dependencies (they are included in the function bundle)
Uses the http.IncomingMessage and http.ServerResponse from Node.js
opt-in using target: 'serverless' in next.config.js
Does not load next.config.js when executing the function, note that this means publicRuntimeConfig / serverRuntimeConfig are not supported

Browser support
Next.js supports IE11 and all modern browsers out of the box using @babel/preset-env. In order to support IE11 Next.js adds a global Promise polyfill. In cases where your own code or any external NPM dependencies you are using requires features not supported by your target browsers you will need to implement polyfills.
The polyfills example demonstrates the recommended approach to implement polyfills.
TypeScript
TypeScript is supported out of the box in Next.js. To get started using it create a tsconfig.json in your project:
{
  ""compilerOptions"": {
    ""allowJs"": true, /* Allow JavaScript files to be type checked. */
    ""alwaysStrict"": true, /* Parse in strict mode. */
    ""esModuleInterop"": true, /* matches compilation setting */
    ""isolatedModules"": true, /* to match webpack loader */
    ""jsx"": ""preserve"", /* Preserves jsx outside of Next.js. */
    ""lib"": [""dom"", ""es2017""], /* List of library files to be included in the type checking. */
    ""module"": ""esnext"", /* Specifies the type of module to type check. */
    ""moduleResolution"": ""node"", /* Determine how modules get resolved. */
    ""noEmit"": true, /* Do not emit outputs. Makes sure tsc only does type checking. */

    /* Strict Type-Checking Options, optional, but recommended. */
    ""noFallthroughCasesInSwitch"": true, /* Report errors for fallthrough cases in switch statement. */
    ""noUnusedLocals"": true, /* Report errors on unused locals. */
    ""noUnusedParameters"": true, /* Report errors on unused parameters. */
    ""strict"": true /* Enable all strict type-checking options. */,
   
    ""target"": ""esnext"" /* The type checking input. */
  }
}
After adding the tsconfig.json you need to install @types to get proper TypeScript typing.
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
Now can change any file from .js to .ts / .tsx (tsx is for files using JSX). To learn more about TypeScript checkout out its documentation.
Exported types
Next.js provides NextPage type that can be used for pages in the pages directory. NextPage adds definitions for getInitialProps so that it can be used without any extra typing needed.
import { NextPage } from 'next'

interface Props {
  pathname: string
}

const Page: NextPage<Props> = ({ pathname }) => (
  <main>Your request pathname: {pathname}</main>
)

Page.getInitialProps = async ({ pathname }) => {
  return { pathname }
}

export default Page
AMP Support
Enabling AMP Support
To enable AMP support for a page, first enable experimental AMP support in your next.config.js and then import withAmp from next/amp and wrap your page's component in it.
// pages/about.js
import { withAmp } from 'next/amp'

export default withAmp(function AboutPage(props) {
  return (
    <h3>My AMP About Page!</h3>
  )
})
AMP Page Modes
AMP pages can specify two modes:

AMP-only (default)

Pages have no Next.js or React client-side runtime
Pages are automatically optimized with AMP Optimizer, an optimizer that applies the same transformations as AMP caches (improves performance by up to 42%)
Pages have a user-accessible (optimized) version of the page and a search-engine indexable (unoptimized) version of the page
Opt-in via withAmp(Component)


Hybrid

Pages are able to be rendered as traditional HTML (default) and AMP HTML (by adding ?amp=1 to the URL)
The AMP version of the page is not optimized with AMP Optimizer so that it is indexable by search-engines
Opt-in via withAmp(Component, { hybrid: true })



Both of these page modes provide a consistently fast experience for users accessing pages through search engines.
AMP Behavior with next export
When using next export to statically pre-render pages Next.js will detect if the page supports AMP and change the exporting behavior based on that.
Hybrid AMP (pages/about.js) would output:

out/about/index.html - with client-side React runtime
out/about.amp/index.html - AMP page

AMP-only (pages/about.js) would output:

out/about/index.html - Optimized AMP page
out/about.amp/index.html - AMP page

During export Next.js automatically detects if a page is AMP-only and apply dirty/clean optimizations. The dirty version will be output to page/index.html and the clean version will be output to page.amp/index.html. We also automatically insert the <link rel=""amphtml"" href=""/page.amp"" /> and <link rel=""canonical"" href=""/"" /> tags for you.
Adding AMP Components
The AMP community provides many components to make AMP pages more interactive. You can add these components to your page by using next/head:
// pages/hello.js
import Head from 'next/head'
import { withAmp } from 'next/amp'

export default withAmp(function MyAmpPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <script
          async
          key=""amp-timeago""
          custom-element=""amp-timeago""
          src=""https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-timeago-0.1.js""
        />
      </Head>

      <p>Some time: {date.toJSON()}</p>
      <amp-timeago
        width=""0""
        height=""15""
        datetime={date.toJSON()}
        layout=""responsive""
      >
        .
      </amp-timeago>
    </div>
  )
})
AMP Validation
AMP pages are automatically validated with amphtml-validator during development. Errors and warnings will appear in the terminal where you started Next.js.
Pages are also validated during next export and any warnings / errors will be printed to the terminal.
Any AMP errors will cause next export to exit with status code 1 because the export is not valid AMP.
Static HTML export

Examples

Static export


next export is a way to run your Next.js app as a standalone static app without the need for a Node.js server.
The exported app supports almost every feature of Next.js, including dynamic urls, prefetching, preloading and dynamic imports.
The way next export works is by pre-rendering all pages possible to HTML. It does so based on a mapping of pathname key to page object. This mapping is called the exportPathMap.
The page object has 2 values:

page - String the page inside the pages directory to render
query - Object the query object passed to getInitialProps when pre-rendering. Defaults to {}

Usage
Simply develop your app as you normally do with Next.js. Then run:
next build
next export

By default next export doesn't require any configuration. It will generate a default exportPathMap containing the routes to pages inside the pages directory. This default mapping is available as defaultPathMap in the example below.
If your application has dynamic routes you can add a dynamic exportPathMap in next.config.js.
This function is asynchronous and gets the default exportPathMap as a parameter.
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  exportPathMap: async function(defaultPathMap) {
    return {
      '/': { page: '/' },
      '/about': { page: '/about' },
      '/readme.md': { page: '/readme' },
      '/p/hello-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'hello-nextjs' } },
      '/p/learn-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'learn-nextjs' } },
      '/p/deploy-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'deploy-nextjs' } }
    }
  }
}

Note that if the path ends with a directory, it will be exported as /dir-name/index.html, but if it ends with an extension, it will be exported as the specified filename, e.g. /readme.md above. If you use a file extension other than .html, you may need to set the Content-Type header to text/html when serving this content.

Then simply run these commands:
next build
next export
For that you may need to add a NPM script to package.json like this:
{
  ""scripts"": {
    ""build"": ""next build"",
    ""export"": ""npm run build && next export""
  }
}
And run it at once with:
npm run export
Then you have a static version of your app in the out directory.

You can also customize the output directory. For that run next export -h for the help.

Now you can deploy the out directory to any static hosting service. Note that there is an additional step for deploying to GitHub Pages, documented here.
For an example, simply visit the out directory and run following command to deploy your app to ZEIT Now.
now
Copying custom files
In case you have to copy custom files like a robots.txt or generate a sitemap.xml you can do this inside of exportPathMap.
exportPathMap gets a few contextual parameter to aid you with creating/copying files:

dev - true when exportPathMap is being called in development. false when running next export. In development exportPathMap is used to define routes and behavior like copying files is not required.
dir - Absolute path to the project directory
outDir - Absolute path to the out directory (configurable with -o or --outdir). When dev is true the value of outDir will be null.
distDir - Absolute path to the .next directory (configurable using the distDir config key)
buildId - The buildId the export is running for

// next.config.js
const fs = require('fs')
const { join } = require('path')
const { promisify } = require('util')
const copyFile = promisify(fs.copyFile)

module.exports = {
  exportPathMap: async function(
    defaultPathMap,
    { dev, dir, outDir, distDir, buildId }
  ) {
    if (dev) {
      return defaultPathMap
    }
    // This will copy robots.txt from your project root into the out directory
    await copyFile(join(dir, 'robots.txt'), join(outDir, 'robots.txt'))
    return defaultPathMap
  }
}
Limitation
With next export, we build a HTML version of your app. At export time we will run getInitialProps of your pages.
The req and res fields of the context object passed to getInitialProps are not available as there is no server running.

You won't be able to render HTML dynamically when static exporting, as we pre-build the HTML files. If you want to do dynamic rendering use next start or the custom server API

Multi Zones

Examples

With Zones


A zone is a single deployment of a Next.js app. Just like that, you can have multiple zones. Then you can merge them as a single app.
For an example, you can have two zones like this:

https://docs.my-app.com for serving /docs/**
https://ui.my-app.com for serving all other pages

With multi zones support, you can merge both these apps into a single one. Which allows your customers to browse it using a single URL. But you can develop and deploy both apps independently.

This is exactly the same concept as microservices, but for frontend apps.

How to define a zone
There are no special zones related APIs. You only need to do following things:

Make sure to keep only the pages you need in your app. (For an example, https://ui.my-app.com should not contain pages for /docs/**)
Make sure your app has an assetPrefix. (You can also define the assetPrefix dynamically.)

How to merge them
You can merge zones using any HTTP proxy.
You can use micro proxy as your local proxy server. It allows you to easily define routing rules like below:
{
  ""rules"": [
    {
      ""pathname"": ""/docs**"",
      ""method"": [""GET"", ""POST"", ""OPTIONS""],
      ""dest"": ""https://docs.my-app.com""
    },
    { ""pathname"": ""/**"", ""dest"": ""https://ui.my-app.com"" }
  ]
}
For the production deployment, you can use the path alias feature if you are using ZEIT now. Otherwise, you can configure your existing proxy server to route HTML pages using a set of rules as shown above.

FAQ

Is this production ready?
  Next.js has been powering https://zeit.co since its inception.
We’re ecstatic about both the developer experience and end-user performance, so we decided to share it with the community.


How big is it?
The client side bundle size should be measured in a per-app basis.
A small Next main bundle is around 65kb gzipped.


Is this like `create-react-app`?
Yes and No.
Yes in that both make your life easier.
No in that it enforces a structure so that we can do more advanced things like:

Server side rendering
Automatic code splitting

In addition, Next.js provides two built-in features that are critical for every single website:

Routing with lazy component loading: <Link> (by importing next/link)
A way for components to alter <head>: <Head> (by importing next/head)

If you want to create re-usable React components that you can embed in your Next.js app or other React applications, using create-react-app is a great idea. You can later import it and keep your codebase clean!


How do I use CSS-in-JS solutions?
Next.js bundles styled-jsx supporting scoped css. However you can use any CSS-in-JS solution in your Next app by just including your favorite library as mentioned before in the document.


What syntactic features are transpiled? How do I change them?
We track V8. Since V8 has wide support for ES6 and async and await, we transpile those. Since V8 doesn’t support class decorators, we don’t transpile those.
See the documentation about customizing the babel config and next/preset for more information.


Why a new Router?
Next.js is special in that:

Routes don’t need to be known ahead of time
Routes are always lazy-loadable
Top-level components can define getInitialProps that should block the loading of the route (either when server-rendering or lazy-loading)

As a result, we were able to introduce a very simple approach to routing that consists of two pieces:

Every top level component receives a url object to inspect the url or perform modifications to the history
A <Link /> component is used to wrap elements like anchors (<a/>) to perform client-side transitions



How do I define a custom fancy route?
We added the ability to map between an arbitrary URL and any component by supplying a request handler.
On the client side, we have a parameter call as on <Link> that decorates the URL differently from the URL it fetches.


How do I fetch data?
It’s up to you. getInitialProps is an async function (or a regular function that returns a Promise). It can retrieve data from anywhere.


Can I use it with GraphQL?
Yes! Here's an example with Apollo.


Can I use it with Redux and thunk?
Yes! Here's an example


Can I use it with Redux?
Yes! Here's an example


Can I use Next with my favorite Javascript library or toolkit?
Since our first release we've had many example contributions, you can check them out in the examples directory


What is this inspired by?
Many of the goals we set out to accomplish were the ones listed in The 7 principles of Rich Web Applications by Guillermo Rauch.
The ease-of-use of PHP is a great inspiration. We feel Next.js is a suitable replacement for many scenarios where you otherwise would use PHP to output HTML.
Unlike PHP, we benefit from the ES6 module system and every file exports a component or function that can be easily imported for lazy evaluation or testing.
As we were researching options for server-rendering React that didn’t involve a large number of steps, we came across react-page (now deprecated), a similar approach to Next.js by the creator of React Jordan Walke.

This README is just a fast quick start document. You can find more detailed documentation at redis.io.
What is Redis?
Redis is often referred as a data structures server. What this means is that Redis provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands, which are sent using a server-client model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. So different processes can query and modify the same data structures in a shared way.
Data structures implemented into Redis have a few special properties:

Redis cares to store them on disk, even if they are always served and modified into the server memory. This means that Redis is fast, but that is also non-volatile.
Implementation of data structures stress on memory efficiency, so data structures inside Redis will likely use less memory compared to the same data structure modeled using an high level programming language.
Redis offers a number of features that are natural to find in a database, like replication, tunable levels of durability, cluster, high availability.

Another good example is to think of Redis as a more complex version of memcached, where the operations are not just SETs and GETs, but operations to work with complex data types like Lists, Sets, ordered data structures, and so forth.
If you want to know more, this is a list of selected starting points:

Introduction to Redis data types. http://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro

Building Redis
Redis can be compiled and used on Linux, OSX, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD.
We support big endian and little endian architectures, and both 32 bit
and 64 bit systems.
It may compile on Solaris derived systems (for instance SmartOS) but our
support for this platform is best effort and Redis is not guaranteed to
work as well as in Linux, OSX, and *BSD there.
It is as simple as:
% make

You can run a 32 bit Redis binary using:
% make 32bit

After building Redis, it is a good idea to test it using:
% make test

Fixing build problems with dependencies or cached build options
Redis has some dependencies which are included into the deps directory.
make does not automatically rebuild dependencies even if something in
the source code of dependencies changes.
When you update the source code with git pull or when code inside the
dependencies tree is modified in any other way, make sure to use the following
command in order to really clean everything and rebuild from scratch:
make distclean

This will clean: jemalloc, lua, hiredis, linenoise.
Also if you force certain build options like 32bit target, no C compiler
optimizations (for debugging purposes), and other similar build time options,
those options are cached indefinitely until you issue a make distclean
command.
Fixing problems building 32 bit binaries
If after building Redis with a 32 bit target you need to rebuild it
with a 64 bit target, or the other way around, you need to perform a
make distclean in the root directory of the Redis distribution.
In case of build errors when trying to build a 32 bit binary of Redis, try
the following steps:

Install the packages libc6-dev-i386 (also try g++-multilib).
Try using the following command line instead of make 32bit:
make CFLAGS=""-m32 -march=native"" LDFLAGS=""-m32""

Allocator
Selecting a non-default memory allocator when building Redis is done by setting
the MALLOC environment variable. Redis is compiled and linked against libc
malloc by default, with the exception of jemalloc being the default on Linux
systems. This default was picked because jemalloc has proven to have fewer
fragmentation problems than libc malloc.
To force compiling against libc malloc, use:
% make MALLOC=libc

To compile against jemalloc on Mac OS X systems, use:
% make MALLOC=jemalloc

Verbose build
Redis will build with a user friendly colorized output by default.
If you want to see a more verbose output use the following:
% make V=1

Running Redis
To run Redis with the default configuration just type:
% cd src
% ./redis-server

If you want to provide your redis.conf, you have to run it using an additional
parameter (the path of the configuration file):
% cd src
% ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

It is possible to alter the Redis configuration by passing parameters directly
as options using the command line. Examples:
% ./redis-server --port 9999 --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379
% ./redis-server /etc/redis/6379.conf --loglevel debug

All the options in redis.conf are also supported as options using the command
line, with exactly the same name.
Playing with Redis
You can use redis-cli to play with Redis. Start a redis-server instance,
then in another terminal try the following:
% cd src
% ./redis-cli
redis> ping
PONG
redis> set foo bar
OK
redis> get foo
""bar""
redis> incr mycounter
(integer) 1
redis> incr mycounter
(integer) 2
redis>

You can find the list of all the available commands at http://redis.io/commands.
Installing Redis
In order to install Redis binaries into /usr/local/bin just use:
% make install

You can use make PREFIX=/some/other/directory install if you wish to use a
different destination.
Make install will just install binaries in your system, but will not configure
init scripts and configuration files in the appropriate place. This is not
needed if you want just to play a bit with Redis, but if you are installing
it the proper way for a production system, we have a script doing this
for Ubuntu and Debian systems:
% cd utils
% ./install_server.sh

Note: install_server.sh will not work on Mac OSX; it is built for Linux only.
The script will ask you a few questions and will setup everything you need
to run Redis properly as a background daemon that will start again on
system reboots.
You'll be able to stop and start Redis using the script named
/etc/init.d/redis_<portnumber>, for instance /etc/init.d/redis_6379.
Code contributions
Note: by contributing code to the Redis project in any form, including sending
a pull request via Github, a code fragment or patch via private email or
public discussion groups, you agree to release your code under the terms
of the BSD license that you can find in the COPYING file included in the Redis
source distribution.
Please see the CONTRIBUTING file in this source distribution for more
information.
Redis internals
If you are reading this README you are likely in front of a Github page
or you just untarred the Redis distribution tar ball. In both the cases
you are basically one step away from the source code, so here we explain
the Redis source code layout, what is in each file as a general idea, the
most important functions and structures inside the Redis server and so forth.
We keep all the discussion at a high level without digging into the details
since this document would be huge otherwise and our code base changes
continuously, but a general idea should be a good starting point to
understand more. Moreover most of the code is heavily commented and easy
to follow.
Source code layout
The Redis root directory just contains this README, the Makefile which
calls the real Makefile inside the src directory and an example
configuration for Redis and Sentinel. You can find a few shell
scripts that are used in order to execute the Redis, Redis Cluster and
Redis Sentinel unit tests, which are implemented inside the tests
directory.
Inside the root are the following important directories:

src: contains the Redis implementation, written in C.
tests: contains the unit tests, implemented in Tcl.
deps: contains libraries Redis uses. Everything needed to compile Redis is inside this directory; your system just needs to provide libc, a POSIX compatible interface and a C compiler. Notably deps contains a copy of jemalloc, which is the default allocator of Redis under Linux. Note that under deps there are also things which started with the Redis project, but for which the main repository is not antirez/redis.

There are a few more directories but they are not very important for our goals
here. We'll focus mostly on src, where the Redis implementation is contained,
exploring what there is inside each file. The order in which files are
exposed is the logical one to follow in order to disclose different layers
of complexity incrementally.
Note: lately Redis was refactored quite a bit. Function names and file
names have been changed, so you may find that this documentation reflects the
unstable branch more closely. For instance in Redis 3.0 the server.c
and server.h files were named redis.c and redis.h. However the overall
structure is the same. Keep in mind that all the new developments and pull
requests should be performed against the unstable branch.
server.h
The simplest way to understand how a program works is to understand the
data structures it uses. So we'll start from the main header file of
Redis, which is server.h.
All the server configuration and in general all the shared state is
defined in a global structure called server, of type struct redisServer.
A few important fields in this structure are:

server.db is an array of Redis databases, where data is stored.
server.commands is the command table.
server.clients is a linked list of clients connected to the server.
server.master is a special client, the master, if the instance is a replica.

There are tons of other fields. Most fields are commented directly inside
the structure definition.
Another important Redis data structure is the one defining a client.
In the past it was called redisClient, now just client. The structure
has many fields, here we'll just show the main ones:
struct client {
    int fd;
    sds querybuf;
    int argc;
    robj **argv;
    redisDb *db;
    int flags;
    list *reply;
    char buf[PROTO_REPLY_CHUNK_BYTES];
    ... many other fields ...
}

The client structure defines a connected client:

The fd field is the client socket file descriptor.
argc and argv are populated with the command the client is executing, so that functions implementing a given Redis command can read the arguments.
querybuf accumulates the requests from the client, which are parsed by the Redis server according to the Redis protocol and executed by calling the implementations of the commands the client is executing.
reply and buf are dynamic and static buffers that accumulate the replies the server sends to the client. These buffers are incrementally written to the socket as soon as the file descriptor is writable.

As you can see in the client structure above, arguments in a command
are described as robj structures. The following is the full robj
structure, which defines a Redis object:
typedef struct redisObject {
    unsigned type:4;
    unsigned encoding:4;
    unsigned lru:LRU_BITS; /* lru time (relative to server.lruclock) */
    int refcount;
    void *ptr;
} robj;

Basically this structure can represent all the basic Redis data types like
strings, lists, sets, sorted sets and so forth. The interesting thing is that
it has a type field, so that it is possible to know what type a given
object has, and a refcount, so that the same object can be referenced
in multiple places without allocating it multiple times. Finally the ptr
field points to the actual representation of the object, which might vary
even for the same type, depending on the encoding used.
Redis objects are used extensively in the Redis internals, however in order
to avoid the overhead of indirect accesses, recently in many places
we just use plain dynamic strings not wrapped inside a Redis object.
server.c
This is the entry point of the Redis server, where the main() function
is defined. The following are the most important steps in order to startup
the Redis server.

initServerConfig() setups the default values of the server structure.
initServer() allocates the data structures needed to operate, setup the listening socket, and so forth.
aeMain() starts the event loop which listens for new connections.

There are two special functions called periodically by the event loop:

serverCron() is called periodically (according to server.hz frequency), and performs tasks that must be performed from time to time, like checking for timedout clients.
beforeSleep() is called every time the event loop fired, Redis served a few requests, and is returning back into the event loop.

Inside server.c you can find code that handles other vital things of the Redis server:

call() is used in order to call a given command in the context of a given client.
activeExpireCycle() handles eviciton of keys with a time to live set via the EXPIRE command.
freeMemoryIfNeeded() is called when a new write command should be performed but Redis is out of memory according to the maxmemory directive.
The global variable redisCommandTable defines all the Redis commands, specifying the name of the command, the function implementing the command, the number of arguments required, and other properties of each command.

networking.c
This file defines all the I/O functions with clients, masters and replicas
(which in Redis are just special clients):

createClient() allocates and initializes a new client.
the addReply*() family of functions are used by commands implementations in order to append data to the client structure, that will be transmitted to the client as a reply for a given command executed.
writeToClient() transmits the data pending in the output buffers to the client and is called by the writable event handler sendReplyToClient().
readQueryFromClient() is the readable event handler and accumulates data from read from the client into the query buffer.
processInputBuffer() is the entry point in order to parse the client query buffer according to the Redis protocol. Once commands are ready to be processed, it calls processCommand() which is defined inside server.c in order to actually execute the command.
freeClient() deallocates, disconnects and removes a client.

aof.c and rdb.c
As you can guess from the names these files implement the RDB and AOF
persistence for Redis. Redis uses a persistence model based on the fork()
system call in order to create a thread with the same (shared) memory
content of the main Redis thread. This secondary thread dumps the content
of the memory on disk. This is used by rdb.c to create the snapshots
on disk and by aof.c in order to perform the AOF rewrite when the
append only file gets too big.
The implementation inside aof.c has additional functions in order to
implement an API that allows commands to append new commands into the AOF
file as clients execute them.
The call() function defined inside server.c is responsible to call
the functions that in turn will write the commands into the AOF.
db.c
Certain Redis commands operate on specific data types, others are general.
Examples of generic commands are DEL and EXPIRE. They operate on keys
and not on their values specifically. All those generic commands are
defined inside db.c.
Moreover db.c implements an API in order to perform certain operations
on the Redis dataset without directly accessing the internal data structures.
The most important functions inside db.c which are used in many commands
implementations are the following:

lookupKeyRead() and lookupKeyWrite() are used in order to get a pointer to the value associated to a given key, or NULL if the key does not exist.
dbAdd() and its higher level counterpart setKey() create a new key in a Redis database.
dbDelete() removes a key and its associated value.
emptyDb() removes an entire single database or all the databases defined.

The rest of the file implements the generic commands exposed to the client.
object.c
The robj structure defining Redis objects was already described. Inside
object.c there are all the functions that operate with Redis objects at
a basic level, like functions to allocate new objects, handle the reference
counting and so forth. Notable functions inside this file:

incrRefcount() and decrRefCount() are used in order to increment or decrement an object reference count. When it drops to 0 the object is finally freed.
createObject() allocates a new object. There are also specialized functions to allocate string objects having a specific content, like createStringObjectFromLongLong() and similar functions.

This file also implements the OBJECT command.
replication.c
This is one of the most complex files inside Redis, it is recommended to
approach it only after getting a bit familiar with the rest of the code base.
In this file there is the implementation of both the master and replica role
of Redis.
One of the most important functions inside this file is replicationFeedSlaves() that writes commands to the clients representing replica instances connected
to our master, so that the replicas can get the writes performed by the clients:
this way their data set will remain synchronized with the one in the master.
This file also implements both the SYNC and PSYNC commands that are
used in order to perform the first synchronization between masters and
replicas, or to continue the replication after a disconnection.
Other C files

t_hash.c, t_list.c, t_set.c, t_string.c and t_zset.c contains the implementation of the Redis data types. They implement both an API to access a given data type, and the client commands implementations for these data types.
ae.c implements the Redis event loop, it's a self contained library which is simple to read and understand.
sds.c is the Redis string library, check http://github.com/antirez/sds for more information.
anet.c is a library to use POSIX networking in a simpler way compared to the raw interface exposed by the kernel.
dict.c is an implementation of a non-blocking hash table which rehashes incrementally.
scripting.c implements Lua scripting. It is completely self contained from the rest of the Redis implementation and is simple enough to understand if you are familar with the Lua API.
cluster.c implements the Redis Cluster. Probably a good read only after being very familiar with the rest of the Redis code base. If you want to read cluster.c make sure to read the Redis Cluster specification.

Anatomy of a Redis command
All the Redis commands are defined in the following way:
void foobarCommand(client *c) {
    printf(""%s"",c->argv[1]->ptr); /* Do something with the argument. */
    addReply(c,shared.ok); /* Reply something to the client. */
}

The command is then referenced inside server.c in the command table:
{""foobar"",foobarCommand,2,""rtF"",0,NULL,0,0,0,0,0},

In the above example 2 is the number of arguments the command takes,
while ""rtF"" are the command flags, as documented in the command table
top comment inside server.c.
After the command operates in some way, it returns a reply to the client,
usually using addReply() or a similar function defined inside networking.c.
There are tons of commands implementations inside the Redis source code
that can serve as examples of actual commands implementations. To write
a few toy commands can be a good exercise to familiarize with the code base.
There are also many other files not described here, but it is useless to
cover everything. We want to just help you with the first steps.
Eventually you'll find your way inside the Redis code base :-)
Enjoy!

The Rust Programming Language
This is the main source code repository for Rust. It contains the compiler,
standard library, and documentation.
Quick Start
Read ""Installation"" from The Book.
Installing from Source
Note: If you wish to contribute to the compiler, you should read
this chapter
of the rustc-guide instead.
Building on *nix


Make sure you have installed the dependencies:

g++ 4.7 or later or clang++ 3.x or later
python 2.7 (but not 3.x)
GNU make 3.81 or later
cmake 3.4.3 or later
curl
git



Clone the source with git:
$ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.git
$ cd rust




Build and install:
$ ./x.py build && sudo ./x.py install
If after running sudo ./x.py install you see an error message like
error: failed to load source for a dependency on 'cc'

then run these two commands and then try sudo ./x.py install again:
$ cargo install cargo-vendor

$ cargo vendor


Note: Install locations can be adjusted by copying the config file
from ./config.toml.example to ./config.toml, and
adjusting the prefix option under [install]. Various other options, such
as enabling debug information, are also supported, and are documented in
the config file.

When complete, sudo ./x.py install will place several programs into
/usr/local/bin: rustc, the Rust compiler, and rustdoc, the
API-documentation tool. This install does not include Cargo,
Rust's package manager, which you may also want to build.


Building on Windows
There are two prominent ABIs in use on Windows: the native (MSVC) ABI used by
Visual Studio, and the GNU ABI used by the GCC toolchain. Which version of Rust
you need depends largely on what C/C++ libraries you want to interoperate with:
for interop with software produced by Visual Studio use the MSVC build of Rust;
for interop with GNU software built using the MinGW/MSYS2 toolchain use the GNU
build.
MinGW
MSYS2 can be used to easily build Rust on Windows:


Grab the latest MSYS2 installer and go through the installer.


Run mingw32_shell.bat or mingw64_shell.bat from wherever you installed
MSYS2 (i.e. C:\msys64), depending on whether you want 32-bit or 64-bit
Rust. (As of the latest version of MSYS2 you have to run msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32 or msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64 from the command line instead)


From this terminal, install the required tools:
# Update package mirrors (may be needed if you have a fresh install of MSYS2)
$ pacman -Sy pacman-mirrors

# Install build tools needed for Rust. If you're building a 32-bit compiler,
# then replace ""x86_64"" below with ""i686"". If you've already got git, python,
# or CMake installed and in PATH you can remove them from this list. Note
# that it is important that you do **not** use the 'python2' and 'cmake'
# packages from the 'msys2' subsystem. The build has historically been known
# to fail with these packages.
$ pacman -S git \
            make \
            diffutils \
            tar \
            mingw-w64-x86_64-python2 \
            mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
            mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc


Navigate to Rust's source code (or clone it), then build it:
$ ./x.py build && ./x.py install


MSVC
MSVC builds of Rust additionally require an installation of Visual Studio 2013
(or later) so rustc can use its linker. Make sure to check the “C++ tools”
option.
With these dependencies installed, you can build the compiler in a cmd.exe
shell with:
> python x.py build
Currently, building Rust only works with some known versions of Visual Studio. If
you have a more recent version installed the build system doesn't understand
then you may need to force rustbuild to use an older version. This can be done
by manually calling the appropriate vcvars file before running the bootstrap.
> CALL ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\amd64\vcvars64.bat""
> python x.py build
Specifying an ABI
Each specific ABI can also be used from either environment (for example, using
the GNU ABI in PowerShell) by using an explicit build triple. The available
Windows build triples are:

GNU ABI (using GCC)

i686-pc-windows-gnu
x86_64-pc-windows-gnu


The MSVC ABI

i686-pc-windows-msvc
x86_64-pc-windows-msvc



The build triple can be specified by either specifying --build=<triple> when
invoking x.py commands, or by copying the config.toml file (as described
in Building From Source), and modifying the build option under the [build]
section.
Configure and Make
While it's not the recommended build system, this project also provides a
configure script and makefile (the latter of which just invokes x.py).
$ ./configure
$ make && sudo make install
When using the configure script, the generated config.mk file may override the
config.toml file. To go back to the config.toml file, delete the generated
config.mk file.
Building Documentation
If you’d like to build the documentation, it’s almost the same:
$ ./x.py doc
The generated documentation will appear under doc in the build directory for
the ABI used. I.e., if the ABI was x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, the directory will be
build\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\doc.
Notes
Since the Rust compiler is written in Rust, it must be built by a
precompiled ""snapshot"" version of itself (made in an earlier stage of
development). As such, source builds require a connection to the Internet, to
fetch snapshots, and an OS that can execute the available snapshot binaries.
Snapshot binaries are currently built and tested on several platforms:



Platform / Architecture
x86
x86_64




Windows (7, 8, 10, ...)
✓
✓


Linux (2.6.18 or later)
✓
✓


OSX (10.7 Lion or later)
✓
✓



You may find that other platforms work, but these are our officially
supported build environments that are most likely to work.
There is more advice about hacking on Rust in CONTRIBUTING.md.
Getting Help
The Rust community congregates in a few places:

Stack Overflow - Direct questions about using the language.
users.rust-lang.org - General discussion and broader questions.
/r/rust - News and general discussion.

Contributing
To contribute to Rust, please see CONTRIBUTING.
Rust has an IRC culture and most real-time collaboration happens in a
variety of channels on Mozilla's IRC network, irc.mozilla.org. The
most popular channel is #rust, a venue for general discussion about
Rust. And a good place to ask for help would be #rust-beginners.
The rustc guide might be a good place to start if you want to find out how
various parts of the compiler work.
Also, you may find the rustdocs for the compiler itself useful.

  Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.









Fast: Yarn caches every package it has downloaded, so it never needs to download the same package again. It also does almost everything concurrently to maximize resource utilization. This means even faster installs.
Reliable: Using a detailed but concise lockfile format and a deterministic algorithm for install operations, Yarn is able to guarantee that any installation that works on one system will work exactly the same on another system.
Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.
Features

Offline Mode. If you've installed a package before, then you can install it again without an internet connection.
Deterministic. The same dependencies will be installed in the same exact way on any machine, regardless of installation order.
Network Performance. Yarn efficiently queues requests and avoids request waterfalls in order to maximize network utilization.
Network Resilience. A single request that fails will not cause the entire installation to fail. Requests are automatically retried upon failure.
Flat Mode. Yarn resolves mismatched versions of dependencies to a single version to avoid creating duplicates.
More emojis. 🐈

Installing Yarn
Read the Installation Guide on our website for detailed instructions on how to install Yarn.
Using Yarn
Read the Usage Guide on our website for detailed instructions on how to use Yarn.
Contributing to Yarn
Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Substantial feature requests should be proposed as an RFC. Before contributing, please read the code of conduct.

Community
We use the google group as
our mailing list (use English only). Subscribe via nwjs-general+subscribe@googlegroups.com.
NOTE: Links to the old google group (e.g. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/node-webkit/doRWZ07LgWQ/4fheV8FF8zsJ) that are no longer working can be fixed by replacing node-webkit with nwjs-general (e.g https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/nwjs-general/doRWZ07LgWQ/4fheV8FF8zsJ).
Issues are being tracked here on GitHub.
The source code for NW.js and the daily development spans across multiple repositories in this organization. This repository is for the purpose of issue tracking, landing page and part of the source code.
Verifying Binaries
Starting from 0.32.0 the stable and nightly download directories contain a SHASUMS256.txt
file that lists the SHA checksums for each file available for download, as well as the
checksums for the files inside the download package.
The SHASUMS256.txt can be downloaded using curl.
$ curl -O https://dl.nwjs.io/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt
To check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, run
it through sha256sum with a command such as:
$ grep nwjs-vx.y.z.tar.gz SHASUMS256.txt | sha256sum -c -
The stable releases (but not Nightlies) also have the GPG detached
signature of SHASUMS256.txt available as SHASUMS256.txt.asc. You can use gpg
to verify that SHASUMS256.txt has not been tampered with.
To verify SHASUMS256.txt has not been altered, you will first need to import
the GPG key of NW.js maintainer to create releases.
Use this command to import the key:
$ gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 78680FA9E21BB40A
(Key fingerprint is 1E8B EE8D 5B0C 4CBC D6D1  9E26 7868 0FA9 E21B B40A)

Next, download the SHASUMS256.txt.asc for the release:
$ curl -O https://dl.nwjs.io/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt.asc
After downloading the appropriate SHASUMS256.txt and SHASUMS256.txt.asc files,
you can then use gpg --verify SHASUMS256.txt.asc SHASUMS256.txt to verify
that the file has been signed by an authorized member of the NW.js team.
Once verified, use the SHASUMS256.txt file to get the checksum for
the binary verification command above.

Hacker Scripts
Based on a true
story:

xxx: OK, so, our build engineer has left for another company. The dude was literally living inside the terminal. You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that.


xxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, ""legacy""


xxx: You're gonna love this


xxx: smack-my-bitch-up.sh - sends a text message ""late at work"" to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.


xxx: kumar-asshole.sh - scans the inbox for emails from ""Kumar"" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like ""help"", ""trouble"", ""sorry"" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply ""no worries mate, be careful next time"".


xxx: hangover.sh - another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like ""not feeling well/gonna work from home"" etc. Adds a random ""reason"" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.


xxx: (and the oscar goes to) fucking-coffee.sh - this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like sys brew. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk.


xxx: holy sh*t I'm keeping those

scikit-learn
scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
SciPy and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.
The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the About us page
for a list of core contributors.
It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.
Website: http://scikit-learn.org

Installation

Dependencies
scikit-learn requires:

Python (>= 3.5)
NumPy (>= 1.11.0)
SciPy (>= 0.17.0)
joblib (>= 0.11)

Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python2.7.
Scikit-learn 0.21 and later require Python 3.5 or newer.
For running the examples Matplotlib >= 1.5.1 is required. A few examples
require scikit-image >= 0.12.3, a few examples require pandas >= 0.18.0.
scikit-learn also uses CBLAS, the C interface to the Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms library. scikit-learn comes with a reference implementation, but
the system CBLAS will be detected by the build system and used if present.
CBLAS exists in many implementations; see Linear algebra libraries
for known issues.

User installation
If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using pip
pip install -U scikit-learn

Extended details and known issues
Additional detail and explanation of the esoteric parts of normalize.css.
pre, code, kbd, samp
The font-family: monospace, monospace hack fixes the inheritance and scaling
of font-size for preformatted text. The duplication of monospace is
intentional. Source.
sub, sup
Normally, using sub or sup affects the line-box height of text in all
browsers. Source.
select
By default, Chrome on OS X and Safari on OS X allow very limited styling of
select, unless a border property is set. The default font weight on optgroup
elements cannot safely be changed in Chrome on OSX and Safari on OS X.
[type=""checkbox""]
It is recommended that you do not style checkbox and radio inputs as Firefox's
implementation does not respect box-sizing, padding, or width.
[type=""number""]
Certain font size values applied to number inputs cause the cursor style of the
decrement button to change from default to text.
[type=""search""]
The search input is not fully stylable by default. In Chrome and Safari on
OSX/iOS you can't control font, padding, border, or background. In
Chrome and Safari on Windows you can't control border properly. It will apply
border-width but will only show a border color (which cannot be controlled)
for the outer 1px of that border. Applying -webkit-appearance: textfield
addresses these issues without removing the benefits of search inputs (e.g.
showing past searches).

Overview
Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go.
It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability.
Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.
Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can run Hugo from any directory.
This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.
Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second.
A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.
Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs.
Supported Architectures
Currently, we provide pre-built Hugo binaries for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS (Darwin), and Android for x64, i386 and ARM architectures.
Hugo may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, and Solaris.
Complete documentation is available at Hugo Documentation.
Choose How to Install
If you want to use Hugo as your site generator, simply install the Hugo binaries.
The Hugo binaries have no external dependencies.
To contribute to the Hugo source code or documentation, you should fork the Hugo GitHub project and clone it to your local machine.
Finally, you can install the Hugo source code with go, build the binaries yourself, and run Hugo that way.
Building the binaries is an easy task for an experienced go getter.
Install Hugo as Your Site Generator (Binary Install)
Use the installation instructions in the Hugo documentation.
Build and Install the Binaries from Source (Advanced Install)
Prerequisite Tools

Git
Go (at least Go 1.11)

Fetch from GitHub
Since Hugo 0.48, Hugo uses the Go Modules support built into Go 1.11 to build. The easiest is to clone Hugo in a directory outside of GOPATH, as in the following example:
mkdir $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git
cd hugo
go install
If you are a Windows user, substitute the $HOME environment variable above with %USERPROFILE%.
The Hugo Documentation
The Hugo documentation now lives in its own repository, see https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs. But we do keep a version of that documentation as a git subtree in this repository. To build the sub folder /docs as a Hugo site, you need to clone this repo:
git clone git@github.com:gohugoio/hugo.git
Contributing to Hugo
For a complete guide to contributing to Hugo, see the Contribution Guide.
We welcome contributions to Hugo of any kind including documentation, themes,
organization, tutorials, blog posts, bug reports, issues, feature requests,
feature implementations, pull requests, answering questions on the forum,
helping to manage issues, etc.
The Hugo community and maintainers are very active and helpful, and the project benefits greatly from this activity.
Asking Support Questions
We have an active discussion forum where users and developers can ask questions.
Please don't use the GitHub issue tracker to ask questions.
Reporting Issues
If you believe you have found a defect in Hugo or its documentation, use
the GitHub issue tracker to report the problem to the Hugo maintainers.
If you're not sure if it's a bug or not, start by asking in the discussion forum.
When reporting the issue, please provide the version of Hugo in use (hugo version).
Submitting Patches
The Hugo project welcomes all contributors and contributions regardless of skill or experience level.
If you are interested in helping with the project, we will help you with your contribution.
Hugo is a very active project with many contributions happening daily.
Because we want to create the best possible product for our users and the best contribution experience for our developers,
we have a set of guidelines which ensure that all contributions are acceptable.
The guidelines are not intended as a filter or barrier to participation.
If you are unfamiliar with the contribution process, the Hugo team will help you and teach you how to bring your contribution in accordance with the guidelines.

impress.js

It's a presentation framework based on the power of CSS3 transforms and
transitions in modern browsers and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com.
WARNING
impress.js may not help you if you have nothing interesting to say ;)
HOW TO USE IT
Checking out and initializing the git repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/impress/impress.js.git
cd impress.js

Note: For a minimal checkout, omit the --recursive option. This will leave out extra plugins.
Stable releases
New features and fixes are continuously merged into the master branch, which is what the above command will check out. For the latest stable release, see the Github Releases page.
Documentation
Reference documentation of core impress.js features and API you can find it in DOCUMENTATION.md.
The HTML source code of the official impress.js demo serves as a good example usage and contains comments explaning various features of impress.js. For more information about styling you can look into CSS code which shows how classes provided by impress.js can be used. Last but not least JavaScript code of impress.js has some useful comments if you are interested in how everything works. Feel free to explore!
Official demo
impress.js demo by @bartaz
Examples and demos
The Classic Slides demo is targeted towards beginners, or can be used as a template for presentations that look like the traditional PowerPoint slide deck. Over time, it also grew into the example presentation that uses most of the features and addons available.
More examples and demos can be found on Examples and demos wiki page.
Feel free to add your own example presentations (or websites) there.
Other tutorials and learning resources
If you want to learn even more there is a list of tutorials and other learning resources
on the wiki, too.
There is also a book available about Building impressive presentations with impress.js by Rakhitha Nimesh Ratnayake.
You may want to check out the sibling project Impressionist: a 3D GUI editor that can help you in creating impress.js presentations.
Mailing list
You're welcome to ask impress.js related questions on the impressionist-presentations mailing list.
REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

index.html: This is the official impress.js demo, showcasing all of the features of the original impress.js, as well as some new plugins as we add them.

As already mentioned, this file is well commented and acts as the official tutorial.


examples/: Contains several demos showcasing additional features available.

Classic Slides is a simple demo that you can use as template if you want to create very simple, rectangular, PowerPoint-like presentations.


src/: The main file is src/impress.js. Additional functionality is implemented as plugins in src/plugins/.

See src/plugins/README.md for information about the plugin API and how to write plugins.


test/: Contains QUnit and Syn libraries that we use for writing tests, as well as some test coverage for core functionality. (Yes, more tests are much welcome.) Tests for plugins are in the directory of each plugin.
js/: Contains js/impress.js, which contains a concatenation of the core src/impress.js and all the plugins. Traditionally this is the file that you'll link to in a browser. In fact both the demo and test files do exactly that.
css/: Contains a CSS file used by the demo. This file is not required for using impress.js in your own presentations. Impress.js creates the CSS it needs dynamically.
extras/ contains plugins that for various reasons aren't enabled by default. You have to explicitly add them with their own script element to use them.
build.js: Simple build file that creates js/impress.js. It also creates a minified version impress.min.js, but that one is not included in the github repository.
package.json: An NPM package specification. This was mainly added so you can easily install buildify and run node build.js. Other than the build process, which is really just doing roughly cat src/impress.js src/plugins/*/*.js > js/impress.js, and testing, impress.js itself doesn't depend on Node or any NPM modules.
bower.json: A Bower package file. We also don't depend on Bower, but provide this file if you want to use it.

WANT TO CONTRIBUTE?
For developers, once you've made changes to the code, you should run these commands for testing:
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
npm run lint

Note that running firefox qunit_test_runner.html is usually more informative than running karma with npm run test. They both run the same tests.
More info about the src/ directory can be found in src/plugins/README.md.
Requirements

>= node 7.6
npm

ABOUT THE NAME
impress.js name is courtesy of @skuzniak.
It's an (un)fortunate coincidence that a Open/LibreOffice presentation tool is called Impress ;)
Reference API
See the Reference API
BROWSER SUPPORT
The design goal for impress.js has been to showcase awesome CSS3 features as found in modern browser versions. We also use some new DOM functionality, and specifically do not use jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries, nor our own functions, to support older browsers. In general, recent versions of Firefox and Chrome are known to work well. Reportedly IE now works too.
The typical use case for impress.js is to create presentations that you present from your own laptop, with a browser version you know works well. Some people also use impress.js successfully to embed animations or presentations in a web page, however, be aware that in this some of your visitors may not see the presentation correctly, or at all.
In particular, impress.js makes use of the following JS and CSS features:

DataSet API
ClassList API
CSS 3D Transforms
CSS Transitions

Bulma
Bulma is a modern CSS framework based on Flexbox.






Quick install
Bulma is constantly in development! Try it out now:
NPM
npm install bulma
or
Yarn
yarn add bulma
Bower
bower install bulma
Import
After installation, you can import the CSS file into your project using this snippet:
import 'bulma/css/bulma.css'
CDN
https://cdnjs.com/libraries/bulma
Feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.
CSS only
Bulma is a CSS framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file: bulma.css
You can either use that file, ""out of the box"", or download the Sass source files to customize the variables.
There is no JavaScript included. People generally want to use their own JS implementation (and usually already have one). Bulma can be considered ""environment agnostic"": it's just the style layer on top of the logic.
Browser Support
Bulma uses autoprefixer to make (most) Flexbox features compatible with earlier browser versions. According to Can I use, Bulma is compatible with recent versions of:

Chrome
Edge
Firefox
Opera
Safari

Internet Explorer (10+) is only partially supported.
Documentation
The documentation resides in the docs directory, and is built with the Ruby-based Jekyll tool.

Installation and Update
Install & Update script
To install or update nvm, you can use the install script using cURL:
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
or Wget:
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
The script clones the nvm repository to ~/.nvm and adds the source line to your profile (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc).
Note: If the environment variable $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is present, it will place the nvm files there.
export NVM_DIR=""${XDG_CONFIG_HOME/:-$HOME/.}nvm""
[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" # This loads nvm
Note: You can add --no-use to the end of the above script (...nvm.sh --no-use) to postpone using nvm until you manually use it.
You can customize the install source, directory, profile, and version using the NVM_SOURCE, NVM_DIR, PROFILE, and NODE_VERSION variables.
Eg: curl ... | NVM_DIR=""path/to/nvm"". Ensure that the NVM_DIR does not contain a trailing slash.
NB. The installer can use git, curl, or wget to download nvm, whatever is available.
Note: On Linux, after running the install script, if you get nvm: command not found or see no feedback from your terminal after you type:
command -v nvm
simply close your current terminal, open a new terminal, and try verifying again.
Note: Since OS X 10.9, /usr/bin/git has been preset by Xcode command line tools, which means we can't properly detect if Git is installed or not. You need to manually install the Xcode command line tools before running the install script, otherwise, it'll fail. (see #1782)
Note: On OS X, if you get nvm: command not found after running the install script, one of the following might be the reason:-

your system may not have a [.bash_profile file] where the command is set up. Simply create one with touch ~/.bash_profile and run the install script again
you might need to restart your terminal instance. Try opening a new tab/window in your terminal and retry.

If the above doesn't fix the problem, open your .bash_profile and add the following line of code:
source ~/.bashrc

For more information about this issue and possible workarounds, please refer here

Ansible
You can use a task:
- name: nvm
  shell: >
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
  args:
    creates: ""{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.nvm/nvm.sh""

Verify installation
To verify that nvm has been installed, do:
command -v nvm
which should output 'nvm' if the installation was successful. Please note that which nvm will not work, since nvm is a sourced shell function, not an executable binary.
Important Notes
If you're running a system without prepackaged binary available, which means you're going to install nodejs or io.js from its source code, you need to make sure your system has a C++ compiler. For OS X, Xcode will work, for Debian/Ubuntu based GNU/Linux, the build-essential and libssl-dev packages work.
Note: nvm does not support Windows (see #284), but may work in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) depending on the version of WSL. For Windows, two alternatives exist, which are neither supported nor developed by us:

nvm-windows
nodist

Note: nvm does not support Fish either (see #303). Alternatives exist, which are neither supported nor developed by us:

bass allows you to use utilities written for Bash in fish shell
fast-nvm-fish only works with version numbers (not aliases) but doesn't significantly slow your shell startup
plugin-nvm plugin for Oh My Fish, which makes nvm and its completions available in fish shell
fnm - fisherman-based version manager for fish
fish-nvm - Wrapper around nvm for fish, delays sourcing nvm until it's actually used.

Note: We still have some problems with FreeBSD, because there is no official pre-built binary for FreeBSD, and building from source may need patches; see the issue ticket:

[#900] [Bug] nodejs on FreeBSD may need to be patched
nodejs/node#3716

Note: On OS X, if you do not have Xcode installed and you do not wish to download the ~4.3GB file, you can install the Command Line Tools. You can check out this blog post on how to just that:

How to Install Command Line Tools in OS X Mavericks & Yosemite (Without Xcode)

Note: On OS X, if you have/had a ""system"" node installed and want to install modules globally, keep in mind that:

When using nvm you do not need sudo to globally install a module with npm -g, so instead of doing sudo npm install -g grunt, do instead npm install -g grunt
If you have an ~/.npmrc file, make sure it does not contain any prefix settings (which is not compatible with nvm)
You can (but should not?) keep your previous ""system"" node install, but nvm will only be available to your user account (the one used to install nvm). This might cause version mismatches, as other users will be using /usr/local/lib/node_modules/* VS your user account using ~/.nvm/versions/node/vX.X.X/lib/node_modules/*

Homebrew installation is not supported. If you have issues with homebrew-installed nvm, please brew uninstall it, and install it using the instructions below, before filing an issue.
Note: If you're using zsh you can easily install nvm as a zsh plugin. Install zsh-nvm and run nvm upgrade to upgrade.
Note: Git versions before v1.7 may face a problem of cloning nvm source from GitHub via https protocol, and there is also different behavior of git before v1.6, and git prior to v1.17.10 can not clone tags, so the minimum required git version is v1.7.10. If you are interested in the problem we mentioned here, please refer to GitHub's HTTPS cloning errors article.
Git install
If you have git installed (requires git v1.7.10+):

clone this repo in the root of your user profile


cd ~/ from anywhere then git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git .nvm


cd ~/.nvm and check out the latest version with git checkout v0.34.0
activate nvm by sourcing it from your shell: . nvm.sh

Now add these lines to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.zshrc file to have it automatically sourced upon login:
(you may have to add to more than one of the above files)
export NVM_DIR=""$HOME/.nvm""
[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh""  # This loads nvm
[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/bash_completion""  # This loads nvm bash_completion
Manual Install
For a fully manual install, execute the following lines to first clone the nvm repository into $HOME/.nvm, and then load nvm:
export NVM_DIR=""$HOME/.nvm"" && (
  git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git ""$NVM_DIR""
  cd ""$NVM_DIR""
  git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags --match ""v[0-9]*"" $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)`
) && \. ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh""
Now add these lines to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.zshrc file to have it automatically sourced upon login:
(you may have to add to more than one of the above files)
export NVM_DIR=""$HOME/.nvm""
[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" # This loads nvm
Manual upgrade
For manual upgrade with git (requires git v1.7.10+):

change to the $NVM_DIR
pull down the latest changes
check out the latest version
activate the new version

(
  cd ""$NVM_DIR""
  git fetch --tags origin
  git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags --match ""v[0-9]*"" $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)`
) && \. ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh""
Usage
To download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this:
nvm install node # ""node"" is an alias for the latest version
To install a specific version of node:
nvm install 6.14.4 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc
The first version installed becomes the default. New shells will start with the default version of node (e.g., nvm alias default).
You can list available versions using ls-remote:
nvm ls-remote
And then in any new shell just use the installed version:
nvm use node
Or you can just run it:
nvm run node --version
Or, you can run any arbitrary command in a subshell with the desired version of node:
nvm exec 4.2 node --version
You can also get the path to the executable to where it was installed:
nvm which 5.0
In place of a version pointer like ""0.10"" or ""5.0"" or ""4.2.1"", you can use the following special default aliases with nvm install, nvm use, nvm run, nvm exec, nvm which, etc:

node: this installs the latest version of node
iojs: this installs the latest version of io.js
stable: this alias is deprecated, and only truly applies to node v0.12 and earlier. Currently, this is an alias for node.
unstable: this alias points to node v0.11 - the last ""unstable"" node release, since post-1.0, all node versions are stable. (in SemVer, versions communicate breakage, not stability).

Long-term support
Node has a schedule for long-term support (LTS) You can reference LTS versions in aliases and .nvmrc files with the notation lts/* for the latest LTS, and lts/argon for LTS releases from the ""argon"" line, for example. In addition, the following commands support LTS arguments:

nvm install --lts / nvm install --lts=argon / nvm install 'lts/*' / nvm install lts/argon
nvm uninstall --lts / nvm uninstall --lts=argon / nvm uninstall 'lts/*' / nvm uninstall lts/argon
nvm use --lts / nvm use --lts=argon / nvm use 'lts/*' / nvm use lts/argon
nvm exec --lts / nvm exec --lts=argon / nvm exec 'lts/*' / nvm exec lts/argon
nvm run --lts / nvm run --lts=argon / nvm run 'lts/*' / nvm run lts/argon
nvm ls-remote --lts / nvm ls-remote --lts=argon nvm ls-remote 'lts/*' / nvm ls-remote lts/argon
nvm version-remote --lts / nvm version-remote --lts=argon / nvm version-remote 'lts/*' / nvm version-remote lts/argon

Any time your local copy of nvm connects to https://nodejs.org, it will re-create the appropriate local aliases for all available LTS lines. These aliases (stored under $NVM_DIR/alias/lts), are managed by nvm, and you should not modify, remove, or create these files - expect your changes to be undone, and expect meddling with these files to cause bugs that will likely not be supported.
Migrating global packages while installing
If you want to install a new version of Node.js and migrate npm packages from a previous version:
nvm install node --reinstall-packages-from=node
This will first use ""nvm version node"" to identify the current version you're migrating packages from. Then it resolves the new version to install from the remote server and installs it. Lastly, it runs ""nvm reinstall-packages"" to reinstall the npm packages from your prior version of Node to the new one.
You can also install and migrate npm packages from specific versions of Node like this:
nvm install 6 --reinstall-packages-from=5
nvm install v4.2 --reinstall-packages-from=iojs
Default global packages from file while installing
If you have a list of default packages you want installed every time you install a new version, we support that too -- just add the package names, one per line, to the file $NVM_DIR/default-packages. You can add anything npm would accept as a package argument on the command line.
# $NVM_DIR/default-packages

rimraf
object-inspect@1.0.2
stevemao/left-pad
io.js
If you want to install io.js:
nvm install iojs
If you want to install a new version of io.js and migrate npm packages from a previous version:
nvm install iojs --reinstall-packages-from=iojs
The same guidelines mentioned for migrating npm packages in Node.js are applicable to io.js.
System version of node
If you want to use the system-installed version of node, you can use the special default alias ""system"":
nvm use system
nvm run system --version
Listing versions
If you want to see what versions are installed:
nvm ls
If you want to see what versions are available to install:
nvm ls-remote
Suppressing colorized output
nvm ls, nvm ls-remote and nvm alias usually produce colorized output. You can disable colors with the --no-colors option (or by setting the environment variable TERM=dumb):
nvm ls --no-colors
TERM=dumb nvm ls
To restore your PATH, you can deactivate it:
nvm deactivate
To set a default Node version to be used in any new shell, use the alias 'default':
nvm alias default node
To use a mirror of the node binaries, set $NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR:
export NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/dist
nvm install node

NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/dist nvm install 4.2
To use a mirror of the io.js binaries, set $NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR:
export NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://iojs.org/dist
nvm install iojs-v1.0.3

NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://iojs.org/dist nvm install iojs-v1.0.3
nvm use will not, by default, create a ""current"" symlink. Set $NVM_SYMLINK_CURRENT to ""true"" to enable this behavior, which is sometimes useful for IDEs. Note that using nvm in multiple shell tabs with this environment variable enabled can cause race conditions.
.nvmrc
You can create a .nvmrc file containing a node version number (or any other string that nvm understands; see nvm --help for details) in the project root directory (or any parent directory).
Afterwards, nvm use, nvm install, nvm exec, nvm run, and nvm which will use the version specified in the .nvmrc file if no version is supplied on the command line.
For example, to make nvm default to the latest 5.9 release, the latest LTS version, or the latest node version for the current directory:
$ echo ""5.9"" > .nvmrc

$ echo ""lts/*"" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest LTS version

$ echo ""node"" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest version
Then when you run nvm:
$ nvm use
Found '/path/to/project/.nvmrc' with version <5.9>
Now using node v5.9.1 (npm v3.7.3)
nvm use et. al. will traverse directory structure upwards from the current directory looking for the .nvmrc file. In other words, running nvm use et. al. in any subdirectory of a directory with an .nvmrc will result in that .nvmrc being utilized.
The contents of a .nvmrc file must be the <version> (as described by nvm --help) followed by a newline. No trailing spaces are allowed, and the trailing newline is required.
Deeper Shell Integration
You can use avn to deeply integrate into your shell and automatically invoke nvm when changing directories. avn is not supported by the nvm development team. Please report issues to the avn team.
If you prefer a lighter-weight solution, the recipes below have been contributed by nvm users. They are not supported by the nvm development team. We are, however, accepting pull requests for more examples.
bash
Automatically call nvm use
Put the following at the end of your $HOME/.bashrc:
find-up () {
    path=$(pwd)
    while [[ ""$path"" != """" && ! -e ""$path/$1"" ]]; do
        path=${path%/*}
    done
    echo ""$path""
}

cdnvm(){
    cd ""$@"";
    nvm_path=$(find-up .nvmrc | tr -d '[:space:]')

    # If there are no .nvmrc file, use the default nvm version
    if [[ ! $nvm_path = *[^[:space:]]* ]]; then

        declare default_version;
        default_version=$(nvm version default);

        # If there is no default version, set it to `node`
        # This will use the latest version on your machine
        if [[ $default_version == ""N/A"" ]]; then
            nvm alias default node;
            default_version=$(nvm version default);
        fi

        # If the current version is not the default version, set it to use the default version
        if [[ $(nvm current) != ""$default_version"" ]]; then
            nvm use default;
        fi

        elif [[ -s $nvm_path/.nvmrc && -r $nvm_path/.nvmrc ]]; then
        declare nvm_version
        nvm_version=$(<""$nvm_path""/.nvmrc)

        declare locally_resolved_nvm_version
        # `nvm ls` will check all locally-available versions
        # If there are multiple matching versions, take the latest one
        # Remove the `->` and `*` characters and spaces
        # `locally_resolved_nvm_version` will be `N/A` if no local versions are found
        locally_resolved_nvm_version=$(nvm ls --no-colors $(<""./.nvmrc"") | tail -1 | tr -d '\->*' | tr -d '[:space:]')

        # If it is not already installed, install it
        # `nvm install` will implicitly use the newly-installed version
        if [[ ""$locally_resolved_nvm_version"" == ""N/A"" ]]; then
            nvm install ""$nvm_version"";
        elif [[ $(nvm current) != ""$locally_resolved_nvm_version"" ]]; then
            nvm use ""$nvm_version"";
        fi
    fi
}
alias cd='cdnvm'
This alias would search 'up' from your current directory in order to detect a .nvmrc file. If it finds it, it will switch to that version; if not, it will use the default version.
zsh
Calling nvm use automatically in a directory with a .nvmrc file
Put this into your $HOME/.zshrc to call nvm use automatically whenever you enter a directory that contains an
.nvmrc file with a string telling nvm which node to use:
# place this after nvm initialization!
autoload -U add-zsh-hook
load-nvmrc() {
  local node_version=""$(nvm version)""
  local nvmrc_path=""$(nvm_find_nvmrc)""

  if [ -n ""$nvmrc_path"" ]; then
    local nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version ""$(cat ""${nvmrc_path}"")"")

    if [ ""$nvmrc_node_version"" = ""N/A"" ]; then
      nvm install
    elif [ ""$nvmrc_node_version"" != ""$node_version"" ]; then
      nvm use
    fi
  elif [ ""$node_version"" != ""$(nvm version default)"" ]; then
    echo ""Reverting to nvm default version""
    nvm use default
  fi
}
add-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc
load-nvmrc

Running tests
Tests are written in Urchin. Install Urchin (and other dependencies) like so:
npm install

There are slow tests and fast tests. The slow tests do things like install node
and check that the right versions are used. The fast tests fake this to test
things like aliases and uninstalling. From the root of the nvm git repository,
run the fast tests like this:
npm run test/fast

Run the slow tests like this:
npm run test/slow

Run all of the tests like this:
npm test

Nota bene: Avoid running nvm while the tests are running.
Bash completion
To activate, you need to source bash_completion:
[[ -r $NVM_DIR/bash_completion ]] && \. $NVM_DIR/bash_completion
Put the above sourcing line just below the sourcing line for nvm in your profile (.bashrc, .bash_profile).
Usage
nvm:

$ nvm Tab

alias               deactivate          install             ls                  run                 unload
clear-cache         exec                list                ls-remote           unalias             use
current             help                list-remote         reinstall-packages  uninstall           version

nvm alias:

$ nvm alias Tab

default


$ nvm alias my_alias Tab

v0.6.21        v0.8.26       v0.10.28

nvm use:

$ nvm use Tab

my_alias        default        v0.6.21        v0.8.26       v0.10.28

nvm uninstall:

$ nvm uninstall Tab

my_alias        default        v0.6.21        v0.8.26       v0.10.28

Compatibility Issues
nvm will encounter some issues if you have some non-default settings set. (see #606)
The following are known to cause issues:
Inside ~/.npmrc:
prefix='some/path'
Environment Variables:
$NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
$PREFIX
Shell settings:
set -e
Installing nvm on Alpine Linux
In order to provide the best performance (and other optimisations), nvm will download and install pre-compiled binaries for Node (and npm) when you run nvm install X. The Node project compiles, tests and hosts/provides pre-these compiled binaries which are built for mainstream/traditional Linux distributions (such as Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat et al).
Alpine Linux, unlike mainstream/traditional Linux distributions, is based on BusyBox, a very compact (~5MB) Linux distribution. BusyBox (and thus Alpine Linux) uses a different C/C++ stack to most mainstream/traditional Linux distributions - musl. This makes binary programs built for such mainstream/traditional incompatible with Alpine Linux, thus we cannot simply nvm install X on Alpine Linux and expect the downloaded binary to run correctly - you'll likely see ""...does not exist"" errors if you try that.
There is a -s flag for nvm install which requests nvm download Node source and compile it locally.
If installing nvm on Alpine Linux is still what you want or need to do, you should be able to achieve this by running the following from you Alpine Linux shell:
apk add -U curl bash ca-certificates openssl ncurses coreutils python2 make gcc g++ libgcc linux-headers grep util-linux binutils findutils
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
The Node project has some desire but no concrete plans (due to the overheads of building, testing and support) to offer Alpine-compatible binaries.
As a potential alternative, @mhart (a Node contributor) has some Docker images for Alpine Linux with Node and optionally, npm, pre-installed.
Removal
Manual Uninstall
To remove nvm manually, execute the following:
$ rm -rf ""$NVM_DIR""
Edit ~/.bashrc (or other shell resource config) and remove the lines below:
export NVM_DIR=""$HOME/.nvm""
[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" # This loads nvm
[[ -r $NVM_DIR/bash_completion ]] && \. $NVM_DIR/bash_completion
Docker for development environment
To make the development and testing work easier, we have a Dockerfile for development usage, which is based on Ubuntu 14.04 base image, prepared with essential and useful tools for nvm development, to build the docker image of the environment, run the docker command at the root of nvm repository:
$ docker build -t nvm-dev .
This will package your current nvm repository with our pre-defined development environment into a docker image named nvm-dev, once it's built with success, validate your image via docker images:
$ docker images

REPOSITORY         TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
nvm-dev            latest              9ca4c57a97d8        7 days ago          650 MB
If you got no error message, now you can easily involve in:
$ docker run -h nvm-dev -it nvm-dev

nvm@nvm-dev:~/.nvm$
Please note that it'll take about 8 minutes to build the image and the image size would be about 650MB, so it's not suitable for production usage.
For more information and documentation about docker, please refer to its official website:

https://www.docker.com/
https://docs.docker.com/

Problems


If you try to install a node version and the installation fails, be sure to delete the node downloads from src (~/.nvm/src/) or you might get an error when trying to reinstall them again or you might get an error like the following:
curl: (33) HTTP server doesn't seem to support byte ranges. Cannot resume.


Where's my sudo node? Check out #43


After the v0.8.6 release of node, nvm tries to install from binary packages. But in some systems, the official binary packages don't work due to incompatibility of shared libs. In such cases, use -s option to force install from source:


nvm install -s 0.8.6

If setting the default alias does not establish the node version in new shells (i.e. nvm current yields system), ensure that the system's node PATH is set before the nvm.sh source line in your shell profile (see #658)

Mac OS ""troubleshooting""
nvm node version not found in vim shell
If you set node version to a version other than your system node version nvm use 6.2.1 and open vim and run :!node -v you should see v6.2.1 if you see your system version v0.12.7. You need to run:
sudo chmod ugo-x /usr/libexec/path_helper

Gatsby is a modern framework for blazing fast websites.


Go Beyond Static Websites. Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the
limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps so you can create high-quality,
dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.


Use a Modern Stack for Every Site. No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are
built using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of
whether the data is coming from the same backend.


Load Data From Anywhere. Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it’s Markdown
files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins
to load your data, then develop using Gatsby’s uniform GraphQL interface.


Performance Is Baked In. Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code
splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, and prefetching resources,
and more to ensure your site is fast — no manual tuning required.


Host at Scale for Pennies. Gatsby sites don’t require servers so you can host your entire
site on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site. Many Gatsby sites can be
hosted entirely free on services like GitHub Pages and Netlify.

Data Structures
Linked List

A Linked List is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each
pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure
consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
Singly-linked list: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points to null
Doubly-linked list: linked list in which each node has two pointers, p and n, such that p points to the previous node and n points to the next node; the last node's n pointer points to null
Circular-linked list: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points back to the first node
Time Complexity:

Access: O(n)
Search: O(n)
Insert: O(1)
Remove: O(1)



Stack

A Stack is a collection of elements, with two principle operations: push, which adds to the collection, and
pop, which removes the most recently added element
Last in, first out data structure (LIFO): the most recently added object is the first to be removed
Time Complexity:

Access: O(n)
Search: O(n)
Insert: O(1)
Remove: O(1)



Queue

A Queue is a collection of elements, supporting two principle operations: enqueue, which inserts an element
into the queue, and dequeue, which removes an element from the queue
First in, first out data structure (FIFO): the oldest added object is the first to be removed
Time Complexity:

Access: O(n)
Search: O(n)
Insert: O(1)
Remove: O(1)



Tree

A Tree is an undirected, connected, acyclic graph

Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as
the left child and right child
Full Tree: a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children
Perfect Binary Tree: a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leave have the same depth
Complete Tree: a binary tree in which every level except possibly the last is full and all nodes in the last
level are as far left as possible

Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree, sometimes called BST, is a type of binary tree which maintains the property that the value in each
node must be greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored
in the right sub-tree
Time Complexity:

Access: O(log(n))
Search: O(log(n))
Insert: O(log(n))
Remove: O(log(n))




Trie

A trie, sometimes called a radix or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree that is used to store a dynamic set or associative
array where the keys are usually Strings. No node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position
in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the String associated
with that node, and the root is associated with the empty String.


Fenwick Tree

A Fenwick tree, sometimes called a binary indexed tree, is a tree in concept, but in practice is implemented as an implicit data
structure using an array. Given an index in the array representing a vertex, the index of a vertex's parent or child is calculated
through bitwise operations on the binary representation of its index. Each element of the array contains the pre-calculated sum of
a range of values, and by combining that sum with additional ranges encountered during an upward traversal to the root, the prefix
sum is calculated
Time Complexity:

Range Sum: O(log(n))
Update: O(log(n))




Segment Tree

A Segment tree, is a tree data structure for storing intervals, or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain
a given point
Time Complexity:

Range Query: O(log(n))
Update: O(log(n))




Heap

A Heap is a specialized tree based structure data structure that satisfies the heap property: if A is a parent node of
B, then the key (the value) of node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B with the same ordering applying across the entire heap.
A heap can be classified further as either a ""max heap"" or a ""min heap"". In a max heap, the keys of parent nodes are always greater
than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node. In a min heap, the keys of parent nodes are less than
or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node
Time Complexity:

Access Max / Min: O(1)
Insert: O(log(n))
Remove Max / Min: O(log(n))




Hashing

Hashing is used to map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash
function are called hash values, hash codes, or simply hashes. If two keys map to the same value, a collision occurs
Hash Map: a hash map is a structure that can map keys to values. A hash map uses a hash function to compute
an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
Collision Resolution
Separate Chaining: in separate chaining, each bucket is independent, and contains a list of entries for each index. The
time for hash map operations is the time to find the bucket (constant time), plus the time to iterate through the list
Open Addressing: in open addressing, when a new entry is inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the
hashed-to-slot and proceeding in some sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. The name open addressing refers to
the fact that the location of an item is not always determined by its hash value


Graph

A Graph is an ordered pair of G = (V, E) comprising a set V of vertices or nodes together with a set E of edges or arcs,
which are 2-element subsets of V (i.e. an edge is associated with two vertices, and that association takes the form of the
unordered pair comprising those two vertices)
Undirected Graph: a graph in which the adjacency relation is symmetric. So if there exists an edge from node u to node
v (u -> v), then it is also the case that there exists an edge from node v to node u (v -> u)
Directed Graph: a graph in which the adjacency relation is not symmetric. So if there exists an edge from node u to node v
(u -> v), this does not imply that there exists an edge from node v to node u (v -> u)


Algorithms
Sorting
Quicksort

Stable: No
Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(nlog(n))
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Average Case: O(nlog(n))




Mergesort

Mergesort is also a divide and conquer algorithm. It continuously divides an array into two halves, recurses on both the
left subarray and right subarray and then merges the two sorted halves
Stable: Yes
Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(nlog(n))
Worst Case: O(nlog(n))
Average Case: O(nlog(n))




Bucket Sort

Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket
is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm
Time Complexity:

Best Case: Ω(n + k)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Average Case:Θ(n + k)




Radix Sort

Radix Sort is a sorting algorithm that like bucket sort, distributes elements of an array into a number of buckets. However, radix
sort differs from bucket sort by 're-bucketing' the array after the initial pass as opposed to sorting each bucket and merging
Time Complexity:

Best Case: Ω(nk)
Worst Case: O(nk)
Average Case: Θ(nk)



Graph Algorithms
Depth First Search

Depth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|)


Breadth First Search

Breadth First Search is a graph traversal algorithm which explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next
level neighbors
Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|)


Topological Sort

Topological Sort is the linear ordering of a directed graph's nodes such that for every edge from node u to node v, u
comes before v in the ordering
Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|)

Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph
Time Complexity: O(|V|^2)


Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Bellman-Ford Algorithm is an algorithm that computes the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph
Although it is slower than Dijkstra's, it is more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are
negative numbers
Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(|E|)
Worst Case: O(|V||E|)




Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights, but
no negative cycles
A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes
Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(|V|^3)
Worst Case: O(|V|^3)
Average Case: O(|V|^3)



Prim's Algorithm

Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. In other words, Prim's find a
subset of edges that forms a tree that includes every node in the graph
Time Complexity: O(|V|^2)


Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's Algorithm is also a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree in a graph. However, in Kruskal's, the graph does not
have to be connected
Time Complexity: O(|E|log|V|)


Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms are algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of eventually reaching the globally optimal solution
Problems must exhibit two properties in order to implement a Greedy solution:
Optimal Substructure

An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to the given problem's subproblems


The Greedy Property

An optimal solution is reached by ""greedily"" choosing the locally optimal choice without ever reconsidering previous choices


Example - Coin Change

Given a target amount V cents and a list of denominations of n coins, i.e. we have coinValue[i] (in cents) for coin types i from [0...n - 1],
what is the minimum number of coins that we must use to represent amount V? Assume that we have an unlimited supply of coins of any type
Coins - Penny (1 cent), Nickel (5 cents), Dime (10 cents), Quarter (25 cents)
Assume V = 41. We can use the Greedy algorithm of continuously selecting the largest coin denomination less than or equal to V, subtract that
coin's value from V, and repeat.
V = 41 | 0 coins used
V = 16 | 1 coin used (41 - 25 = 16)
V = 6  | 2 coins used (16 - 10 = 6)
V = 1  | 3 coins used (6 - 5 = 1)
V = 0  | 4 coins used (1 - 1 = 0)
Using this algorithm, we arrive at a total of 4 coins which is optimal



Bitmasks

Bitmasking is a technique used to perform operations at the bit level. Leveraging bitmasks often leads to faster runtime complexity and
helps limit memory usage
Test kth bit: s & (1 << k);
Set kth bit: s |= (1 << k);
Turn off kth bit: s &= ~(1 << k);
Toggle kth bit: s ^= (1 << k);
Multiple by 2n: s << n;
Divide by 2n: s >> n;
Intersection: s & t;
Union: s | t;
Set Subtraction: s & ~t;
Extract lowest set bit: s & (-s);

Big O Notation

Big O Notation is used to describe the upper bound of a particular algorithm. Big O is used to describe worst case scenarios


Little O Notation

Little O Notation is also used to describe an upper bound of a particular algorithm; however, Little O provides a bound
that is not asymptotically tight

Big Ω Omega Notation

Big Omega Notation is used to provide an asymptotic lower bound on a particular algorithm


Little ω Omega Notation

Little Omega Notation is used to provide a lower bound on a particular algorithm that is not asymptotically tight

Theta Θ Notation

Theta Notation is used to provide a bound on a particular algorithm such that it can be ""sandwiched"" between
two constants (one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit) for sufficiently large values

  Front-End Checklist
  

The Front-End Checklist is an exhaustive list of all elements you need to have / to test before launching your website / HTML page to production.

  
    
  
    
    
  
  
    
  
      
    

    
    
  


  How To Use • Contributing • Website • Product Hunt


Other Checklists:

  🎮 Front-End Performance Checklist • 💎 Front-End Design Checklist

It is based on Front-End developers' years of experience, with the additions coming from some other open-source checklists.
Table of Contents

HTML
Webfonts
CSS

Accessibility
SEO
Translations


How to use?
All items in the Front-End Checklist are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential (in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

 means that the item is recommended but can be omitted in some particular situations.
 means that the item is highly recommended and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
 means that the item can't be omitted by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

📖: documentation or article
🛠: online tool / testing tool
📹: media or video content


You can contribute to the Front-End Checklist App reading the README_APP file which explain everything about the project.


Head

Notes: You can find a list of everything that could be found in the <head> of an HTML document.

Meta tag

 Doctype:  The Doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of all your HTML pages.

<!doctype html> <!-- HTML5 -->


📖 Determining the character encoding - HTML5 W3C


The next 2 meta tags (Charset and Viewport) need to come first in the head.

 Charset:  The charset (UTF-8) is declared correctly.

<!-- Set character encoding for the document -->
<meta charset=""utf-8"">

 Viewport:  The viewport is declared correctly.

<!-- Viewport for responsive web design -->
<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover"">

 Title:  A title is used on all pages (SEO: Google calculates the pixel width of the characters used in the title, and it cuts off between 472 and 482 pixels. The average character limit would be around 55-characters).

<!-- Document Title -->
<title>Page Title less than 55 characters</title>


📖 Title - HTML - MDN
🛠 SERP Snippet Generator



 Description:  A meta description is provided, it is unique and doesn't possess more than 150 characters.

<!-- Meta Description -->
<meta name=""description"" content=""Description of the page less than 150 characters"">


📖 Meta Description - HTML - MDN



 Favicons:  Each favicon has been created and displays correctly. If you have only a favicon.ico, put it at the root of your site. Normally you won't need to use any markup. However, it's still good practice to link to it using the example below. Today, PNG format is recommended over .ico format (dimensions: 32x32px).

<!-- Standard favicon -->
<link rel=""icon"" type=""image/x-icon"" href=""https://example.com/favicon.ico"">
<!-- Recommended favicon format -->
<link rel=""icon"" type=""image/png"" href=""https://example.com/favicon.png"">

 Apple Web App Meta:  Apple meta-tags are present.

<!-- Apple Touch Icon (at least 200x200px) -->
<link rel=""apple-touch-icon"" href=""/custom-icon.png"">

<!-- To run web application in full-screen -->
<meta name=""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"" content=""yes"">

<!-- Status Bar Style (see Supported Meta Tags below for available values) -->
<!-- Has no effect unless you have the previous meta tag -->
<meta name=""apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style"" content=""black"">


📖 Configuring Web Applications
📖 Supported Meta Tags



 Windows Tiles:  Windows tiles are present and linked.

<!-- Microsoft Tiles -->
<meta name=""msapplication-config"" content=""browserconfig.xml"" />
Minimum required xml markup for the browserconfig.xml file is as follows:
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<browserconfig>
   <msapplication>
     <tile>
        <square70x70logo src=""small.png""/>
        <square150x150logo src=""medium.png""/>
        <wide310x150logo src=""wide.png""/>
        <square310x310logo src=""large.png""/>
     </tile>
   </msapplication>
</browserconfig>


📖 Browser configuration schema reference



 Canonical:  Use rel=""canonical"" to avoid duplicate content.

<!-- Helps prevent duplicate content issues -->
<link rel=""canonical"" href=""http://example.com/2017/09/a-new-article-to-read.html"">


📖 Use canonical URLs - Search Console Help - Google Support
📖 5 common mistakes with rel=canonical - Google Webmaster Blog


HTML tags

 Language attribute:  The lang attribute of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page.

<html lang=""en"">

 Direction attribute:  The direction of lecture is specified on the html tag (It can be used on another HTML tag).

<html dir=""rtl"">


📖 dir - HTML - MDN



 Alternate language:  The language tag of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page.

<link rel=""alternate"" href=""https://es.example.com/"" hreflang=""es"">

 Conditional comments:  Conditional comments are present for IE if needed.



📖 About conditional comments (Internet Explorer) - MSDN - Microsoft




 RSS feed:  If your project is a blog or has articles, an RSS link was provided.


 CSS Critical:  The CSS critical (or ""above the fold"") collects all the CSS used to render the visible portion of the page. It is embedded before your principal CSS call and between <style></style> in a single line (minified).




🛠 Critical by Addy Osmani on GitHub automates this.



 CSS order:  All CSS files are loaded before any JavaScript files in the <head>. (Except the case where sometimes JS files are loaded asynchronously on top of your page).

Social meta
Visualize and generate automatically our social meta tags with Meta Tags
Facebook OG and Twitter Cards are, for any website, highly recommended. The other social media tags can be considered if you target a particular presence on those and want to ensure the display.

 Facebook Open Graph:  All Facebook Open Graph (OG) are tested and no one is missing or with a false information. Images need to be at least 600 x 315 pixels, although 1200 x 630 pixels is recommended.


Notes: Using og:image:width and og:image:height will specify the image dimensions to the crawler so that it can render the image immediately without having to asynchronously download and process it.

<meta property=""og:type"" content=""website"">
<meta property=""og:url"" content=""https://example.com/page.html"">
<meta property=""og:title"" content=""Content Title"">
<meta property=""og:image"" content=""https://example.com/image.jpg"">
<meta property=""og:description"" content=""Description Here"">
<meta property=""og:site_name"" content=""Site Name"">
<meta property=""og:locale"" content=""en_US"">
<!-- Next tags are optional but recommended -->
<meta property=""og:image:width"" content=""1200"">
<meta property=""og:image:height"" content=""630"">

HTML
Best practices

 HTML5 Semantic Elements:  HTML5 Semantic Elements are used appropriately (header, section, footer, main...).



📖 HTML Reference




 Error pages:  Error 404 page and 5xx exist. Remember that the 5xx error pages need to have their CSS integrated (no external call on the current server).


 Noopener:  In case you are using external links with target=""_blank"", your link should have a rel=""noopener"" attribute to prevent tab nabbing. If you need to support older versions of Firefox, use rel=""noopener noreferrer"".




📖 About rel=noopener



 Clean up comments:  Unnecessary code needs to be removed before sending the page to production.

HTML testing

 W3C compliant:  All pages need to be tested with the W3C validator to identify possible issues in the HTML code.



🛠 W3C validator



 HTML Lint:  I use tools to help me analyze any issues I could have on my HTML code.



🛠 Dirty markup




🛠 webhint



 Link checker:  There are no broken links in my page, verify that you don't have any 404 error.



🛠 W3C Link Checker



 Adblockers test:  Your website shows your content correctly with adblockers enabled (You can provide a message encouraging people to disable their adblocker).



📖 Use AdBlocking in your Dev Environment

Webfonts

Notes: Using webfonts may cause Flash Of Unstyled Text/Flash Of Invisible Text - consider having fallback fonts and/or utilizing webfont loaders to control behavior.

📖 Google Technical considerations about webfonts



 Webfont format:  WOFF, WOFF2 and TTF are supported by all modern browsers.



📖 WOFF - Web Open Font Format - Caniuse.
📖 WOFF 2.0 - Web Open Font Format - Caniuse.
📖 TTF/OTF - TrueType and OpenType font support

CSS

Notes: Take a look at CSS guidelines and Sass Guidelines followed by most  Front-End developers. If you have a doubt about CSS properties, you can visit CSS Reference. There is also a short Code Guide for consistency.


 Responsive Web Design:  The website is using responsive web design.
 CSS Print:  A print stylesheet is provided and is correct on each page.
 Preprocessors:  Your project is using a CSS preprocessor (e.g Sass, Less, Stylus).
 Unique ID:  If IDs are used, they are unique to a page.
 Reset CSS:  A CSS reset (reset, normalize or reboot) is used and up to date. (If you are using a CSS Framework like Bootstrap or Foundation, a Normalize is already included into it.)



📖 Reset.css
📖 Normalize.css
📖 Reboot



 JS prefix:  All classes (or id- used in JavaScript files) begin with js- and are not styled into the CSS files.

<div id=""js-slider"" class=""my-slider"">
<!-- Or -->
<div id=""id-used-by-cms"" class=""js-slider my-slider"">

 embedded or inline CSS:  Avoid at all cost embedding CSS in <style> tags or using inline CSS: only use for valid reasons (e.g. background-image for slider, critical CSS).
 Vendor prefixes:  CSS vendor prefixes are used and are generated accordingly with your browser support compatibility.



🛠 Autoprefixer CSS online


Performance

 Concatenation:  CSS files are concatenated in a single file (Not for HTTP/2).
 Minification:  All CSS files are minified.
 Non-blocking:  CSS files need to be non-blocking to prevent the DOM from taking time to load.



📖 loadCSS by filament group
📖 Example of preload CSS using loadCSS



 Unused CSS:  Remove unused CSS.



🛠 UnCSS Online
🛠 PurifyCSS
🛠 PurgeCSS
🛠 Chrome DevTools Coverage


CSS testing

 Stylelint:  All CSS or SCSS files are without any errors.



🛠 stylelint, a CSS linter
📖 Sass guidelines




 Responsive web design:  All pages were tested at the following breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px (can be more / different according to your analytics).


 CSS Validator:  The CSS was tested and pertinent errors were corrected.




🛠 CSS Validator



 Desktop Browsers:  All pages were tested on all current desktop browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, EDGE...).
 Mobile Browsers:  All pages were tested on all current mobile browsers (Native browser, Chrome, Safari...).
 OS:  All pages were tested on all current OS (Windows, Android, iOS, Mac...).


 Design fidelity:  Depending the project and the quality of the creatives, you may be asked to be close to the design. You can use some tools to compare creatives with your code implementation and ensure consistency.


Pixel Perfect - Chrome Extension


 Reading direction:  All pages need to be tested for LTR and RTL languages if they need to be supported.

Images

Notes: For a complete understanding of image optimization, check the free ebook Essential Image Optimization from Addy Osmani.

Best practices

 Optimization:  All images are optimized to be rendered in the browser. WebP format could be used for critical pages (like Homepage).



🛠 Imagemin
🛠 Use ImageOptim to optimise your images for free.
🛠 Use Kraken.io awesome alternative for both png and jpg optimization. Up to 1mb per files on free plan.
🛠 TinyPNG losslessly optimise png, apng (animated png) and jpg images. Free and paid version available.
🛠 ZorroSVG jpg-like compression for transparent images using svg masking.
🛠 SVGO a Nodejs-based tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics files.
🛠 SVGOMG a web-based GUI version of SVGO for optimising your svgs online.



 Picture/Srcset:  You use picture/srcset to provide the most appropriate image for the current viewport of the user.



📖 How to Build Responsive Images with srcset



 Retina:  You provide layout images 2x or 3x, support retina display.
 Sprite:  Small images are in a sprite file (in the case of icons, they can be in an SVG sprite image).
 Width and Height:  Set width and height attributes on <img> if the final rendered image size is known (can be omitted for CSS sizing).
 Alternative text:  All <img> have an alternative text which describe the image visually.



📖 Alt-texts: The Ultimate Guide



 Lazy loading:  Images are lazyloaded (A noscript fallback is always provided).

⬆ back to top

JavaScript
Best practices

 JavaScript Inline:  You don't have any JavaScript code inline (mixed with your HTML code).
 Concatenation:  JavaScript files are concatenated.
 Minification:  JavaScript files are minified (you can add the .min suffix).



📖 Minify Resources (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)



 JavaScript security: 



📖 Guidelines for Developing Secure Applications Utilizing JavaScript



 noscript tag:  Use <noscript> tag in the HTML body if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser. This will be helpful in client-side rendering heavy apps such as React.js, see examples.

<noscript>
  You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.
</noscript>

 Non-blocking:  JavaScript files are loaded asynchronously using async or deferred using defer attribute.



📖 Remove Render-Blocking JavaScript



 Optimized and updated JS libraries:  All JavaScript libraries used in your project are necessary (prefer Vanilla Javascript for simple functionalities), updated to their latest version and don't overwhelm your JavaScript with unnecessary methods.



📖 You may not need jQuery
📖 Vanilla JavaScript for building powerful web applications



 Modernizr:  If you need to target some specific features you can use a custom Modernizr to add classes in your <html> tag.



🛠 Customize your Modernizr


JavaScript testing

 ESLint:  No errors are flagged by ESLint (based on your configuration or standards rules).

Performance
Best practices

 Goals to achieve:  Your pages should reach these goals:

First Meaningful Paint under 1 second
Time To Interactive under 5 seconds for the ""average"" configuration (a $200 Android on a slow 3G network with 400ms RTT and 400kbps transfer speed) and under 2 seconds for repeat visits
Critical file size under 170Kb gzipped





🛠 Website Page Analysis
🛠 WebPageTest
📖 Size Limit: Make the Web lighter




 Minified HTML:  Your HTML is minified.


 Lazy loading:  Images, scripts and CSS need to be lazy loaded to improve the response time of the current page (See details in their respective sections).


 Cookie size:  If you are using cookies be sure each cookie doesn't exceed 4096 bytes and your domain name doesn't have more than 20 cookies.




📖 Cookie specification: RFC 6265
📖 Cookies
🛠 Browser Cookie Limits



 Third party components:  Third party iframes or components relying on external JS (like sharing buttons) are replaced by static components when possible, thus limiting calls to external APIs and keeping your users activity private.



🛠 Simple sharing buttons generator


Preparing upcoming requests


📖 Explanation of the following techniques



 DNS resolution:  DNS of third-party services that may be needed are resolved in advance during idle time using dns-prefetch.

<link rel=""dns-prefetch"" href=""https://example.com"">

 Preconnection:  DNS lookup, TCP handshake and TLS negotiation with services that will be needed soon is done in advance during idle time using preconnect.

<link rel=""preconnect"" href=""https://example.com"">

 Prefetching:  Resources that will be needed soon (e.g. lazy loaded images) are requested in advance during idle time using prefetch.

<link rel=""prefetch"" href=""image.png"">

 Preloading:  Resources needed in the current page (e.g. scripts placed at the end of <body>) in advance using preload.

<link rel=""preload"" href=""app.js"">


📖 Difference between prefetch and preload


Performance testing

 Google PageSpeed:  All your pages were tested (not only the homepage) and have a score of at least 90/100.

Accessibility

Notes: You can watch the playlist A11ycasts with Rob Dodson 📹

Best practices

 Progressive enhancement:  Major functionality like main navigation and search should work without JavaScript enabled.



📖 Enable / Disable JavaScript in Chrome Developer Tools



 Color contrast:  Color contrast should at least pass WCAG AA (AAA for mobile).



🛠 Contrast ratio


Headings

 H1:  All pages have an H1 which is not the title of the website.
 Headings:  Headings should be used properly and in the right order (H1 to H6).



📹 Why headings and landmarks are so important -- A11ycasts #18


Semantics

 Specific HTML5 input types are used:  This is especially important for mobile devices that show customized keypads and widgets for different types.



📖 Mobile Input Types


Form

 Label:  A label is associated with each input form element. In case a label can't be displayed, use aria-label instead.



📖 Using the aria-label attribute - MDN


Accessibility testing

 Accessibility standards testing:  Use the WAVE tool to test if your page respects the accessibility standards.



🛠 Wave testing



 Keyboard navigation:  Test your website using only your keyboard in a previsible order. All interactive elements are reachable and usable.
 Screen-reader:  All pages were tested in a screen-reader (VoiceOver, ChromeVox, NVDA or Lynx).
 Focus style:  If the focus is disabled, it is replaced by visible state in CSS.

Fira Code: monospaced font with programming ligatures

Problem
Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. For the human brain, sequences like ->, <= or := are single logical tokens, even if they take two or three characters on the screen. Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse and join multiple characters into a single logical one. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but that’s not the case yet.
Solution
Download v1.206 · How to install · Troubleshooting · News & updates

Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like .. or //, ligatures allow us to correct spacing.

Protocol Buffers - Google's data interchange format
Copyright 2008 Google Inc.
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
Overview
Protocol Buffers (a.k.a., protobuf) are Google's language-neutral,
platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. You
can find protobuf's documentation on the Google Developers site.
This README file contains protobuf installation instructions. To install
protobuf, you need to install the protocol compiler (used to compile .proto
files) and the protobuf runtime for your chosen programming language.
Protocol Compiler Installation
The protocol compiler is written in C++. If you are using C++, please follow
the C++ Installation Instructions to install protoc along
with the C++ runtime.
For non-C++ users, the simplest way to install the protocol compiler is to
download a pre-built binary from our release page:
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
In the downloads section of each release, you can find pre-built binaries in
zip packages: protoc-$VERSION-$PLATFORM.zip. It contains the protoc binary
as well as a set of standard .proto files distributed along with protobuf.
If you are looking for an old version that is not available in the release
page, check out the maven repo here:
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/protobuf/protoc/
These pre-built binaries are only provided for released versions. If you want
to use the github master version at HEAD, or you need to modify protobuf code,
or you are using C++, it's recommended to build your own protoc binary from
source.
If you would like to build protoc binary from source, see the C++ Installation
Instructions.
Protobuf Runtime Installation
Protobuf supports several different programming languages. For each programming
language, you can find instructions in the corresponding source directory about
how to install protobuf runtime for that specific language:

Quick Start
The best way to learn how to use protobuf is to follow the tutorials in our
developer guide:

If you want to learn from code examples, take a look at the examples in the
examples directory.

FreeCodeCampChina's open source codebase and curriculum
freeCodeCamp is a friendly open source community where you learn to code and help nonprofits.
We help our campers build job-worthy portfolios of real apps used by real people, while helping nonprofits.
You start by working through our self-paced, browser-based full stack JavaScript curriculum.
By working through our curriculum, you can earn four certifications:
1. Front End Certification
The first section will teach you the basics of how webpages work and also introduce you to JavaScript programming.
Skills you'll practice include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap.
To earn this certification, you'll build 10 front-end projects and implement many JavaScript algorithms.
2. Data Visualization Certification
The second section builds upon the first and introduces you to more advanced topics such as Sass, React and D3.
To earn this certification, you'll build 5 React-apps and 5 Data visualization apps using D3.js.
3. Back End Certification
The third section introduces you to back end development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It also teaches you about the important concept of source control using Git.
To earn this certification, you'll build 5 APIs and 5 full stack apps.
We will accept solutions implemented in any programming language, as long as both a live demo and the source code are publicly accessible.
4. Full Stack Certification
The fourth section is where you'll get real-world experience by working on projects for nonprofits.
We'll pair you with another camper, an agile project manager, and a stakeholder from a nonprofit organization. Together, you'll plan, build and maintain apps that help that nonprofit carry out its mission more effectively.
For this certification, you'll work on two projects from scratch and then maintain/upgrade two existing projects.

This code is running live at freeCodeCamp.cn. We also have Gitter chat rooms, a Medium publication, an interactive forum, a wiki knowledgebase, and even a YouTube channel.

Big List of Naughty Strings
The Big List of Naughty Strings is an evolving list of strings which have a high probability of causing issues when used as user-input data. This is intended for use in helping both automated and manual QA testing; useful for whenever your QA engineer walks into a bar.
Why Test Naughty Strings?
Even multi-billion dollar companies with huge amounts of automated testing can't find every bad input. For example, look at what happens when you try to Tweet a zero-width space (U+200B) on Twitter:

Although this is not a malicious error, and typical users aren't Tweeting weird unicode, an ""internal server error"" for unexpected input is never a positive experience for the user, and may in fact be a symptom of deeper string-validation issues. The Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to help reveal such issues.
Usage
blns.txt consists of newline-delimited strings and comments which are preceded with #. The comments divide the strings into sections for easy manual reading and copy/pasting into input forms. For those who want to access the strings programmatically, a blns.json file is provided containing an array with all the comments stripped out (the scripts folder contains a Python script used to generate the blns.json).
Contributions
Feel free to send a pull request to add more strings, or additional sections. However, please do not send pull requests with very-long strings (255+ characters), as that makes the list much more difficult to view.
Likewise, please do not send pull requests which compromise manual usability of the file. This includes the EICAR test string, which can cause the file to be flagged by antivirus scanners, and files which alter the encoding of blns.txt. Also, do not send a null character (U+0000) string, as it changes the file format on GitHub to binary and renders it unreadable in pull requests. Finally, when adding or removing a string please update all files when you perform a pull request.
Disclaimer
The Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to be used for software you own and manage. Some of the Naughty Strings can indicate security vulnerabilities, and as a result using such strings with third-party software may be a crime. The maintainer is not responsible for any negative actions that result from the use of the list.
Additionally, the Big List of Naughty Strings is not a fully-comprehensive substitute for formal security/penetration testing for your service.

OkHttp
An HTTP & HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications. For more information see the
website and the wiki.
Requirements
OkHttp works on Android 5.0+ (API level 21+) and on Java 8+.
OkHttp has one library dependency on Okio, a small library for high-performance I/O. It
works with either Okio 1.x (implemented in Java) or Okio 2.x (upgraded to Kotlin).
We highly recommend you keep OkHttp up-to-date. As with auto-updating web browsers, staying current
with HTTPS clients is an important defense against potential security problems. We
track the dynamic TLS ecosystem and adjust OkHttp to improve connectivity and
security.
OkHttp uses your platform's built-in TLS implementation. On Java platforms OkHttp also supports
Conscrypt, which integrates BoringSSL with Java. OkHttp will use Conscrypt if it is
the first security provider:
Security.insertProviderAt(Conscrypt.newProvider(), 1);
The OkHttp 3.12.x branch supports Android 2.3+ (API level 9+) and Java 7+. These platforms lack
support for TLS 1.2 and should not be used. But because upgrading is difficult we will backport
critical fixes to the 3.12.x branch through December 31, 2020.
Download
Download the latest JAR or configure this dependency:
implementation(""com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.14.1"")
Snapshots of the development version are available in Sonatype's snapshots repository.
MockWebServer
A library for testing HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 clients.
MockWebServer coupling with OkHttp is essential for proper testing of HTTP/2 so that code can be shared.

Usage
AFURLSessionManager
AFURLSessionManager creates and manages an NSURLSession object based on a specified NSURLSessionConfiguration object, which conforms to <NSURLSessionTaskDelegate>, <NSURLSessionDataDelegate>, <NSURLSessionDownloadDelegate>, and <NSURLSessionDelegate>.
Creating a Download Task
NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
AFURLSessionManager *manager = [[AFURLSessionManager alloc] initWithSessionConfiguration:configuration];

NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@""http://example.com/download.zip""];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:URL];

NSURLSessionDownloadTask *downloadTask = [manager downloadTaskWithRequest:request progress:nil destination:^NSURL *(NSURL *targetPath, NSURLResponse *response) {
    NSURL *documentsDirectoryURL = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory inDomain:NSUserDomainMask appropriateForURL:nil create:NO error:nil];
    return [documentsDirectoryURL URLByAppendingPathComponent:[response suggestedFilename]];
} completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSURL *filePath, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@""File downloaded to: %@"", filePath);
}];
[downloadTask resume];
Creating an Upload Task
NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
AFURLSessionManager *manager = [[AFURLSessionManager alloc] initWithSessionConfiguration:configuration];

NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@""http://example.com/upload""];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:URL];

NSURL *filePath = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@""file://path/to/image.png""];
NSURLSessionUploadTask *uploadTask = [manager uploadTaskWithRequest:request fromFile:filePath progress:nil completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, id responseObject, NSError *error) {
    if (error) {
        NSLog(@""Error: %@"", error);
    } else {
        NSLog(@""Success: %@ %@"", response, responseObject);
    }
}];
[uploadTask resume];
Creating an Upload Task for a Multi-Part Request, with Progress
NSMutableURLRequest *request = [[AFHTTPRequestSerializer serializer] multipartFormRequestWithMethod:@""POST"" URLString:@""http://example.com/upload"" parameters:nil constructingBodyWithBlock:^(id<AFMultipartFormData> formData) {
        [formData appendPartWithFileURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@""file://path/to/image.jpg""] name:@""file"" fileName:@""filename.jpg"" mimeType:@""image/jpeg"" error:nil];
    } error:nil];

AFURLSessionManager *manager = [[AFURLSessionManager alloc] initWithSessionConfiguration:[NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration]];

NSURLSessionUploadTask *uploadTask;
uploadTask = [manager
              uploadTaskWithStreamedRequest:request
              progress:^(NSProgress * _Nonnull uploadProgress) {
                  // This is not called back on the main queue.
                  // You are responsible for dispatching to the main queue for UI updates
                  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                      //Update the progress view
                      [progressView setProgress:uploadProgress.fractionCompleted];
                  });
              }
              completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse * _Nonnull response, id  _Nullable responseObject, NSError * _Nullable error) {
                  if (error) {
                      NSLog(@""Error: %@"", error);
                  } else {
                      NSLog(@""%@ %@"", response, responseObject);
                  }
              }];

[uploadTask resume];
Creating a Data Task
NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
AFURLSessionManager *manager = [[AFURLSessionManager alloc] initWithSessionConfiguration:configuration];

NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@""http://httpbin.org/get""];
NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:URL];

NSURLSessionDataTask *dataTask = [manager dataTaskWithRequest:request completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, id responseObject, NSError *error) {
    if (error) {
        NSLog(@""Error: %@"", error);
    } else {
        NSLog(@""%@ %@"", response, responseObject);
    }
}];
[dataTask resume];

Request Serialization
Request serializers create requests from URL strings, encoding parameters as either a query string or HTTP body.
NSString *URLString = @""http://example.com"";
NSDictionary *parameters = @{@""foo"": @""bar"", @""baz"": @[@1, @2, @3]};
Query String Parameter Encoding
[[AFHTTPRequestSerializer serializer] requestWithMethod:@""GET"" URLString:URLString parameters:parameters error:nil];
GET http://example.com?foo=bar&baz[]=1&baz[]=2&baz[]=3

URL Form Parameter Encoding
[[AFHTTPRequestSerializer serializer] requestWithMethod:@""POST"" URLString:URLString parameters:parameters error:nil];
POST http://example.com/
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

foo=bar&baz[]=1&baz[]=2&baz[]=3

JSON Parameter Encoding
[[AFJSONRequestSerializer serializer] requestWithMethod:@""POST"" URLString:URLString parameters:parameters error:nil];
POST http://example.com/
Content-Type: application/json

{""foo"": ""bar"", ""baz"": [1,2,3]}


Network Reachability Manager
AFNetworkReachabilityManager monitors the reachability of domains, and addresses for both WWAN and WiFi network interfaces.

Do not use Reachability to determine if the original request should be sent.

You should try to send it.


You can use Reachability to determine when a request should be automatically retried.

Although it may still fail, a Reachability notification that the connectivity is available is a good time to retry something.


Network reachability is a useful tool for determining why a request might have failed.

After a network request has failed, telling the user they're offline is better than giving them a more technical but accurate error, such as ""request timed out.""



See also WWDC 2012 session 706, ""Networking Best Practices."".
Shared Network Reachability
[[AFNetworkReachabilityManager sharedManager] setReachabilityStatusChangeBlock:^(AFNetworkReachabilityStatus status) {
    NSLog(@""Reachability: %@"", AFStringFromNetworkReachabilityStatus(status));
}];

[[AFNetworkReachabilityManager sharedManager] startMonitoring];

Security Policy
AFSecurityPolicy evaluates server trust against pinned X.509 certificates and public keys over secure connections.
Adding pinned SSL certificates to your app helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and other vulnerabilities. Applications dealing with sensitive customer data or financial information are strongly encouraged to route all communication over an HTTPS connection with SSL pinning configured and enabled.
Allowing Invalid SSL Certificates
AFHTTPSessionManager *manager = [AFHTTPSessionManager manager];
manager.securityPolicy.allowInvalidCertificates = YES; // not recommended for production

Unit Tests
AFNetworking includes a suite of unit tests within the Tests subdirectory. These tests can be run simply be executed the test action on the platform framework you would like to test.

Intro
Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
Input
foo(reallyLongArg(), omgSoManyParameters(), IShouldRefactorThis(), isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne());
Output
foo(
  reallyLongArg(),
  omgSoManyParameters(),
  IShouldRefactorThis(),
  isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne()
);
Prettier can be run in your editor on-save, in a pre-commit hook, or in CI environments to ensure your codebase has a consistent style without devs ever having to post a nit-picky comment on a code review ever again!

Guava: Google Core Libraries for Java


Guava is a set of core libraries that includes new collection types (such as
multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, functional
types, an in-memory cache, and APIs/utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing,
primitives, reflection, string processing, and much more!
Guava comes in two flavors.

The JRE flavor requires JDK 1.8 or higher.
If you need support for JDK 1.7 or Android, use the Android flavor. You can
find the Android Guava source in the android directory.

Adding Guava to your build
Guava's Maven group ID is com.google.guava and its artifact ID is guava.
Guava provides two different ""flavors"": one for use on a (Java 8+) JRE and one
for use on Android or Java 7 or by any library that wants to be compatible with
either of those. These flavors are specified in the Maven version field as
either 27.1-jre or 27.1-android. For more about depending on
Guava, see using Guava in your build.
To add a dependency on Guava using Maven, use the following:
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
  <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
  <version>27.1-jre</version>
  <!-- or, for Android: -->
  <version>27.1-android</version>
</dependency>
To add a dependency using Gradle:
dependencies {
  compile 'com.google.guava:guava:27.1-jre'
  // or, for Android:
  api 'com.google.guava:guava:27.1-android'
}
Snapshots
Snapshots of Guava built from the master branch are available through Maven
using version HEAD-jre-SNAPSHOT, or HEAD-android-SNAPSHOT for the Android
flavor.

IMPORTANT WARNINGS


APIs marked with the @Beta annotation at the class or method level
are subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even
removed, at any time. If your code is a library itself (i.e. it is
used on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control), you should
not use beta APIs, unless you repackage them. If your
code is a library, we strongly recommend using the Guava Beta Checker to
ensure that you do not use any @Beta APIs!


APIs without @Beta will remain binary-compatible for the indefinite
future. (Previously, we sometimes removed such APIs after a deprecation period.
The last release to remove non-@Beta APIs was Guava 21.0.) Even @Deprecated
APIs will remain (again, unless they are @Beta). We have no plans to start
removing things again, but officially, we're leaving our options open in case
of surprises (like, say, a serious security problem).


Guava has one dependency that is needed at runtime:
com.google.guava:failureaccess:1.0


Serialized forms of ALL objects are subject to change unless noted
otherwise. Do not persist these and assume they can be read by a
future version of the library.


Our classes are not designed to protect against a malicious caller.
You should not use them for communication between trusted and
untrusted code.


For the mainline flavor, we unit-test the libraries using only OpenJDK 1.8 on
Linux. Some features, especially in com.google.common.io, may not work
correctly in other environments. For the Android flavor, our unit tests run on
API level 15 (Ice Cream Sandwich).

Features

🚀 Blazing fast bundle times - multicore compilation, and a filesystem cache for fast rebuilds even after a restart.
📦 Out of the box support for JS, CSS, HTML, file assets, and more - no plugins to install.
🐠 Automatically transforms modules using Babel, PostCSS, and PostHTML when needed - even node_modules.
✂️ Zero configuration code splitting using dynamic import() statements.
🔥 Built in support for hot module replacement
🚨 Friendly error logging experience - syntax highlighted code frames help pinpoint the problem.

Getting started

Install with yarn:

yarn global add parcel-bundler
or with npm:
npm install -g parcel-bundler

Parcel can take any type of file as an entry point, but a HTML or JavaScript file is a good place to start. If you link your main JavaScript file in the HTML using a relative path, Parcel will also process it for you, and replace the reference with a URL to the output file.

<html>
<body>
  <script src=""./index.js""></script>
</body>
</html>

Parcel has a development server built in which will automatically rebuild your app as you change files and supports hot module replacement for fast development. Just point it at your entry file:

parcel index.html

Now open http://localhost:1234/ in your browser. If needed, you can also override the default port with the -p option. Add --open to automatically open a browser.

See parceljs.org for more documentation!
Benchmarks
Based on a reasonably sized app, containing 1726 modules, 6.5M uncompressed. Built on a 2016 MacBook Pro with 4 physical CPUs.

parcel - with cache

Why parcel?
There are many web application bundlers out there with huge adoption, including webpack and browserify. So, why do we need another one? The main reasons are around developer experience.
Many bundlers are built around configuration and plugins, and it is not uncommon to see applications with upwards of 500 lines of configuration just to get things working. This configuration is not just tedious and time consuming, but is also hard to get right and must be duplicated for each application. Oftentimes, this can lead to sub-optimized apps shipping to production. parcel is designed to need zero configuration: just point it at the entry point of your application, and it does the right thing.
Existing bundlers are also very slow. Large applications with lots of files and many dependencies can take minutes to build, which is especially painful during development, when things change all the time. File watchers can help with rebuilds, but the initial launch is often still very slow.
parcel utilizes worker processes to compile your code in parallel, utilizing modern multicore processors. This results in a huge boost in speed for initial builds. It also has a file system cache, which saves the compiled results per file, for even faster subsequent startups.
Finally, existing bundlers are built around string loaders/transforms, where the transform takes in a string, parses it, does some transformation, and generates code again. Oftentimes, this ends up causing many parses and code generation runs on a single file, which is inefficient. Instead, parcel's transforms work on ASTs, so that there is one parse, many transforms, and one code generation per file.
How it works
parcel transforms a tree of assets into a tree of bundles. Many other bundlers are fundamentally based around JavaScript assets, with other formats tacked on - for example, by default inlined as strings into JS files. parcel is file-type agnostic - it will work with any type of assets the way you'd expect, with no configuration.
parcel takes as input a single entry asset, which could be any file type: JS, HTML, CSS, image, etc. There are various asset types defined in parcel which know how to handle specific file types. The assets are parsed, their dependencies are extracted, and they are transformed to their final compiled form. This creates a tree of assets.
Once the asset tree has been constructed, the assets are placed into a bundle tree. A bundle is created for the entry asset, and child bundles are created for dynamic imports, which cause code splitting to occur. Child bundles are also created when assets of a different type are imported. For example, if you imported a CSS file from JavaScript, it would be placed into a sibling bundle in correlation to the associated JavaScript file. If an asset is required in more than one bundle, it is hoisted up to the nearest common ancestor in the bundle tree, so it is not included more than once.
After the bundle tree is constructed, each bundle is written to a file by a packager specific to the file type. The packagers know how to combine the code from each asset together into the final file that is loaded by a browser.

Enable advanced UIs without modifications to the core
Maximize extensibility

See the Introduction wiki page and Roadmap
for more information.
Features

Modern GUIs
API access
from any language including C/C++, C#, Clojure, D, Elixir, Go, Haskell, Java,
JavaScript/Node.js, Julia, Lisp, Lua, Perl, Python, Racket, Ruby, Rust
Embedded, scriptable terminal emulator
Asynchronous job control

Install from package
Pre-built packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux are found on the
Releases page.
Managed packages are in Homebrew, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux,
Gentoo, and more!
Install from source
The build is CMake-based, but a Makefile is provided as a convenience.
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
sudo make install

To install to a non-default location:
make CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/full/path/
make install

To skip bundled (third-party/*) dependencies:

Install the dependencies using a package manager.
sudo apt install gperf luajit luarocks libuv1-dev libluajit-5.1-dev libunibilium-dev libmsgpack-dev libtermkey-dev libvterm-dev
sudo luarocks build mpack
sudo luarocks build lpeg
sudo luarocks build inspect


Build with USE_BUNDLED=OFF:
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo USE_BUNDLED=OFF
sudo make install



To inspect the build, these CMake features are useful:

cmake --build build --target help lists all build targets.
build/CMakeCache.txt (or cmake -LAH build/) contains the resolved values of all CMake variables.
build/compile_commands.json shows the full compiler invocations for each translation unit.

See the Building Neovim wiki page for details.
Transitioning from Vim
See :help nvim-from-vim for instructions.

Material Design Lite






An implementation of Material Design
components in vanilla CSS, JS, and HTML.

Material Design Lite (MDL) lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your
static content websites. It doesn't rely on any JavaScript frameworks or
libraries. Optimized for cross-device use, gracefully degrades in older
browsers, and offers an experience that is accessible from the get-go.

Limited support


Material Design Lite is now in limited support, with development having moved to the
Material Components for the web repository.


No further development is taking place in MDL by the core team, but we are happy to review PRs, fix critical bugs and
push out new releases. No breaking changes will be accepted.

Use MDL on your site?
This document is targeted at developers that will contribute to or compile
MDL. If you are looking to use MDL on your website or web app please head to
getmdl.io.

A-grade browsers are fully supported. B-grade browsers will gracefully degrade
to our CSS-only experience.
Download / Clone
Clone the repo using Git:
git clone https://github.com/google/material-design-lite.git
Alternatively you can download
this repository.
Windows users, if you have trouble compiling due to line endings then make sure
you configure git to checkout the repository with lf (unix) line endings. This
can be achieved by setting core.eol.
git config core.eol lf
git config core.autocrlf input
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard

Remember, the master branch is considered unstable. Do not use this in
production. Use a tagged state of the repository, npm, or bower for stability!

Feature requests
MDL is currently in limited support mode, with no further development taking place by the core team.
We are happy to accept and review pull requests for new functionality, however, as long as there are no breaking
changes.
Want to contribute?
If you found a bug, have any questions or want to contribute. Follow our
guidelines,
and help improve the Material Design Lite. For more information visit our
wiki.
Please use the default branch, mdl-1.x.
Take note that Material Components for Web, which is MDL v2, is under early Alpha stages (which means everything is a moving target, and we can change anything at any moment). Use with caution.
However, we would absolutely love to have people testing MCW and provide feedback about their experiences using it, especially integrating with other frameworks and libraries.

The streaming build system

        
What is gulp?

Automation - gulp is a toolkit that helps you automate painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow.
Platform-agnostic - Integrations are built into all major IDEs and people are using gulp with PHP, .NET, Node.js, Java, and other platforms.
Strong Ecosystem - Use npm modules to do anything you want + over 2000 curated plugins for streaming file transformations
Simple - By providing only a minimal API surface, gulp is easy to learn and simple to use

What's new in 4.0?!

The task system was rewritten from the ground-up, allowing task composition using series() and parallel() methods
The watcher was updated, now using chokidar (no more need for gulp-watch!), with feature parity to our task system
First-class support was added for incremental builds using lastRun()
A symlink() method was exposed to create symlinks instead of copying files
Built-in support for sourcemaps was added - the gulp-sourcemaps plugin is no longer necessary!
Task registration of exported functions - using node or ES exports - is now recommended
Custom registries were designed, allowing for shared tasks or augmented functionality
Stream implementations were improved, allowing for better conditional and phased builds

Installation
Follow our Quick Start guide.
Roadmap
Find out about all our work-in-progress and outstanding issues at https://github.com/orgs/gulpjs/projects.
Documentation
Check out the Getting Started guide and API docs on our website!
Excuse our dust! All other docs will be behind until we get everything updated. Please open an issue if something isn't working.
Sample gulpfile.js
This file will give you a taste of what gulp does.
var gulp = require('gulp');
var less = require('gulp-less');
var babel = require('gulp-babel');
var concat = require('gulp-concat');
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');
var rename = require('gulp-rename');
var cleanCSS = require('gulp-clean-css');
var del = require('del');

var paths = {
  styles: {
    src: 'src/styles/**/*.less',
    dest: 'assets/styles/'
  },
  scripts: {
    src: 'src/scripts/**/*.js',
    dest: 'assets/scripts/'
  }
};

/* Not all tasks need to use streams, a gulpfile is just another node program
 * and you can use all packages available on npm, but it must return either a
 * Promise, a Stream or take a callback and call it
 */
function clean() {
  // You can use multiple globbing patterns as you would with `gulp.src`,
  // for example if you are using del 2.0 or above, return its promise
  return del([ 'assets' ]);
}

/*
 * Define our tasks using plain functions
 */
function styles() {
  return gulp.src(paths.styles.src)
    .pipe(less())
    .pipe(cleanCSS())
    // pass in options to the stream
    .pipe(rename({
      basename: 'main',
      suffix: '.min'
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.styles.dest));
}

function scripts() {
  return gulp.src(paths.scripts.src, { sourcemaps: true })
    .pipe(babel())
    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(concat('main.min.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.scripts.dest));
}

function watch() {
  gulp.watch(paths.scripts.src, scripts);
  gulp.watch(paths.styles.src, styles);
}

/*
 * Specify if tasks run in series or parallel using `gulp.series` and `gulp.parallel`
 */
var build = gulp.series(clean, gulp.parallel(styles, scripts));

/*
 * You can use CommonJS `exports` module notation to declare tasks
 */
exports.clean = clean;
exports.styles = styles;
exports.scripts = scripts;
exports.watch = watch;
exports.build = build;
/*
 * Define default task that can be called by just running `gulp` from cli
 */
exports.default = build;
Use latest JavaScript version in your gulpfile
Most new versions of node support most features that Babel provides, except the import/export syntax. When only that syntax is desired, rename to gulpfile.esm.js, install the [esm][esm-module] module, and skip the Babel portion below.
Node already supports a lot of ES2015+ features, but to avoid compatibility problems we suggest to install Babel and rename your gulpfile.js to gulpfile.babel.js.
npm install --save-dev @babel/register @babel/core @babel/preset-env
Then create a .babelrc file with the preset configuration.
{
  ""presets"": [ ""@babel/preset-env"" ]
}
And here's the same sample from above written in ES2015+.
import gulp from 'gulp';
import less from 'gulp-less';
import babel from 'gulp-babel';
import concat from 'gulp-concat';
import uglify from 'gulp-uglify';
import rename from 'gulp-rename';
import cleanCSS from 'gulp-clean-css';
import del from 'del';

const paths = {
  styles: {
    src: 'src/styles/**/*.less',
    dest: 'assets/styles/'
  },
  scripts: {
    src: 'src/scripts/**/*.js',
    dest: 'assets/scripts/'
  }
};

/*
 * For small tasks you can export arrow functions
 */
export const clean = () => del([ 'assets' ]);

/*
 * You can also declare named functions and export them as tasks
 */
export function styles() {
  return gulp.src(paths.styles.src)
    .pipe(less())
    .pipe(cleanCSS())
    // pass in options to the stream
    .pipe(rename({
      basename: 'main',
      suffix: '.min'
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.styles.dest));
}

export function scripts() {
  return gulp.src(paths.scripts.src, { sourcemaps: true })
    .pipe(babel())
    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(concat('main.min.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.scripts.dest));
}

 /*
  * You could even use `export as` to rename exported tasks
  */
function watchFiles() {
  gulp.watch(paths.scripts.src, scripts);
  gulp.watch(paths.styles.src, styles);
}
export { watchFiles as watch };

const build = gulp.series(clean, gulp.parallel(styles, scripts));
/*
 * Export a default task
 */
export default build;
Incremental Builds
You can filter out unchanged files between runs of a task using
the gulp.src function's since option and gulp.lastRun:
const paths = {
  ...
  images: {
    src: 'src/images/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png}',
    dest: 'build/img/'
  }
}

function images() {
  return gulp.src(paths.images.src, {since: gulp.lastRun(images)})
    .pipe(imagemin({optimizationLevel: 5}))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.images.dest));
}

function watch() {
  gulp.watch(paths.images.src, images);
}
Task run times are saved in memory and are lost when gulp exits. It will only
save time during the watch task when running the images task
for a second time.

Installation
CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.0.0-beta.5'
Carthage
Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:
github ""Alamofire/Alamofire"" ""5.0.0-beta.5""

Swift Package Manager
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. It is in early development, but Alamofire does support its use on supported platforms.
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.
Swift 4
dependencies: [
    .package(url: ""https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git"", from: ""5.0.0-beta.5"")
]
Manually
If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Alamofire into your project manually.
Embedded Framework


Open up Terminal, cd into your top-level project directory, and run the following command ""if"" your project is not initialized as a git repository:
$ git init


Add Alamofire as a git submodule by running the following command:
$ git submodule add https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git


Open the new Alamofire folder, and drag the Alamofire.xcodeproj into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.

It should appear nested underneath your application's blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.



Select the Alamofire.xcodeproj in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.


Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the ""Targets"" heading in the sidebar.


In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the ""General"" panel.


Click on the + button under the ""Embedded Binaries"" section.


You will see two different Alamofire.xcodeproj folders each with two different versions of the Alamofire.framework nested inside a Products folder.

It does not matter which Products folder you choose from, but it does matter whether you choose the top or bottom Alamofire.framework.



Select the top Alamofire.framework for iOS and the bottom one for macOS.

You can verify which one you selected by inspecting the build log for your project. The build target for Alamofire will be listed as either Alamofire iOS, Alamofire macOS, Alamofire tvOS or Alamofire watchOS.



And that's it!

The Alamofire.framework is automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.



Open Radars
The following radars have some effect on the current implementation of Alamofire.

rdar://21349340 - Compiler throwing warning due to toll-free bridging issue in test case
rdar://26870455 - Background URL Session Configurations do not work in the simulator
rdar://26849668 - Some URLProtocol APIs do not properly handle URLRequest

Resolved Radars
The following radars have been resolved over time after being filed against the Alamofire project.

rdar://26761490 - Swift string interpolation causing memory leak with common usage.

(Resolved): 9/1/17 in Xcode 9 beta 6.


rdar://36082113 - URLSessionTaskMetrics failing to link on watchOS 3.0+

(Resolved): Just add CFNetwork to your linked frameworks.



FAQ
What's the origin of the name Alamofire?
Alamofire is named after the Alamo Fire flower, a hybrid variant of the Bluebonnet, the official state flower of Texas.
Credits
Alamofire is owned and maintained by the Alamofire Software Foundation. You can follow them on Twitter at @AlamofireSF for project updates and releases.
Security Disclosure
If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability with Alamofire, you should report it as soon as possible via email to security@alamofire.org. Please do not post it to a public issue tracker.
Donations
The ASF is looking to raise money to officially stay registered as a federal non-profit organization.
Registering will allow us members to gain some legal protections and also allow us to put donations to use, tax free.
Donating to the ASF will enable us to:

Pay our yearly legal fees to keep the non-profit in good status
Pay for our mail servers to help us stay on top of all questions and security issues
Potentially fund test servers to make it easier for us to test the edge cases
Potentially fund developers to work on one of our projects full-time

The community adoption of the ASF libraries has been amazing.
We are greatly humbled by your enthusiasm around the projects, and want to continue to do everything we can to move the needle forward.
With your continued support, the ASF will be able to improve its reach and also provide better legal safety for the core members.
If you use any of our libraries for work, see if your employers would be interested in donating.
Any amount you can donate today to help us reach our goal would be greatly appreciated.

Requirements
Mandatory requirements

jQuery v. 1.6+
jQuery UI widget factory v. 1.9+ (included): Required for the basic File Upload plugin, but very lightweight without any other dependencies from the jQuery UI suite.
jQuery Iframe Transport plugin (included): Required for browsers without XHR file upload support.

Optional requirements

JavaScript Templates engine v. 2.5.4+: Used to render the selected and uploaded files for the Basic Plus UI and jQuery UI versions.
JavaScript Load Image library v. 1.13.0+: Required for the image previews and resizing functionality.
JavaScript Canvas to Blob polyfill v. 2.1.1+:Required for the image previews and resizing functionality.
blueimp Gallery v. 2.15.1+: Used to display the uploaded images in a lightbox.
Bootstrap v. 3.2.0+
Glyphicons

The user interface of all versions, except the jQuery UI version, is built with Bootstrap and icons from Glyphicons.
Cross-domain requirements
Cross-domain File Uploads using the Iframe Transport plugin require a redirect back to the origin server to retrieve the upload results. The example implementation makes use of result.html as a static redirect page for the origin server.
The repository also includes the jQuery XDomainRequest Transport plugin, which enables limited cross-domain AJAX requests in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (IE 10 supports cross-domain XHR requests).
The XDomainRequest object allows GET and POST requests only and doesn't support file uploads. It is used on the Demo to delete uploaded files from the cross-domain demo file upload service.
Custom Backends
You can add support for various backends by adhering to the specification outlined here.
Browsers
Desktop browsers
The File Upload plugin is regularly tested with the latest browser versions and supports the following minimal versions:

Google Chrome

The easiest way to deploy Ghost is with our official Ghost(Pro) managed service. You can have a fresh instance up and running in a couple of clicks with a worldwide CDN, backups, security and maintenance all done for you.
Not only will it save you hours of maintenance per month, but all revenue goes to the Ghost Foundation, which funds the maintenance and further development of Ghost itself. So you’ll be supporting open source software and getting a great service! Alternatively if you'd like to support us, we're very grateful to all our backers on Open Collective ❤️
 
Quickstart Install
If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use our CLI tool
$ npm install ghost-cli -g

 
Then, if installing locally add the local flag to get up and running in under a minute - Local install docs
$ ghost install local

 
or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - Production install docs
$ ghost install

 
Check out our official documentation for more information about our recommended hosting stack & properly upgrading Ghost, plus everything you need to develop your own Ghost themes or work with our API.

The Serverless Framework – Build applications comprised of microservices that run in response to events, auto-scale for you, and only charge you when they run.  This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.
The Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more.  It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.
Serverless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team.

Kotlin Programming Language
Welcome to Kotlin! Some handy links:

Kotlin Eclipse Plugin
Kotlin Sublime Text Package

Build environment requirements
In order to build Kotlin distribution you need to have:


JDK 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 9


Setup environment variables as following:
  JAVA_HOME=""path to JDK 1.8""
  JDK_16=""path to JDK 1.6""
  JDK_17=""path to JDK 1.7""
  JDK_18=""path to JDK 1.8""
  JDK_9=""path to JDK 9""



For local development, if you're not working on bytecode generation or the standard library, it's OK to have only JDK 1.8 and JDK 9 installed, and to point JDK_16 and JDK_17 environment variables to your JDK 1.8 installation.
You also can use Gradle properties to setup JDK_* variables.

Note: The JDK 6 for MacOS is not available on Oracle's site. You can download it here.

On Windows you might need to add long paths setting to the repo:
git config core.longpaths true 

Building
The project is built with Gradle. Run Gradle to build the project and to run the tests
using the following command on Unix/macOS:
./gradlew <tasks-and-options>

or the following command on Windows:
gradlew <tasks-and-options>

On the first project configuration gradle will download and setup the dependencies on

intellij-core is a part of command line compiler and contains only necessary APIs.
idea-full is a full blown IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to be used in the plugin module.

These dependencies are quite large, so depending on the quality of your internet connection
you might face timeouts getting them. In this case you can increase timeout by specifying the following
command line parameters on the first run:
./gradlew -Dhttp.socketTimeout=60000 -Dhttp.connectionTimeout=60000

Important gradle tasks

clean - clean build results
dist - assembles the compiler distribution into dist/kotlinc/ folder
ideaPlugin - assembles the Kotlin IDEA plugin distribution into dist/artifacts/Kotlin folder
install - build and install all public artifacts into local maven repository
runIde - build IDEA plugin and run IDEA with it
coreLibsTest - build and run stdlib, reflect and kotlin-test tests
gradlePluginTest - build and run gradle plugin tests
compilerTest - build and run all compiler tests
ideaPluginTest - build and run all IDEA plugin tests

OPTIONAL: Some artifacts, mainly Maven plugin ones, are built separately with Maven.
Refer to libraries/ReadMe.md for details.
Building for different versions of IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio
Kotlin plugin is intended to work with several recent versions of IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio. Each platform is allowed to have a different set of features and might provide a slightly different API. Instead of using several parallel Git branches, project stores everything in a single branch, but files may have counterparts with version extensions (*.as32, *.172, *.181). The primary file is expected to be replaced with its counterpart when targeting non-default platform.
More detailed description of this scheme can be found at https://github.com/JetBrains/bunches/blob/master/ReadMe.md.
Usually, there's no need to care about multiple platforms as all features are enabled everywhere by default. Additional counterparts should be created if there's an expected difference in behavior or an incompatible API usage is required and there's no reasonable workaround to save source compatibility. Kotlin plugin contains a pre-commit check that shows a warning if a file has been updated without its counterparts.
Development for some particular platform is possible after 'switching' that can be done with Bunch Tool from the command line.
cd kotlin-project-dir

# switching to IntelliJ Idea 2018.2
bunch switch . 182
 Working with the project in IntelliJ IDEA
Working with the Kotlin project requires at least IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3. You can download IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3 here.
After cloning the project, to import the project in Intellij choose the project directory in the Open project dialog. Then, after project opened, Select
File -> New... -> Module from Existing Sources in the menu, and select build.gradle.kts file in the project's root folder.
In the import dialog, select use default gradle wrapper.
To be able to run tests from IntelliJ easily, check Delegate IDE build/run actions to Gradle and choose Gradle Test Runner in the Gradle runner settings after importing the project.
At this time, you can use the latest released 1.2.x version of the Kotlin plugin for working with the code. To make sure you have the latest version installed, use Tools | Kotlin | Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates and press ""Check for updates now"".
Compiling and running
From this root project there are Run/Debug Configurations for running IDEA or the Compiler Tests for example; so if you want to try out the latest and greatest IDEA plugin

VCS -> Git -> Pull
Run the ""IDEA"" run configuration in the project
a child IntelliJ IDEA with the Kotlin plugin will then startup

Including into composite build
To include kotlin compiler into composite build you need to define dependencySubstitution for kotlin-compiler module in settings.gradle
includeBuild('/path/to/kotlin') {
    dependencySubstitution {
        substitute module('org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler') with project(':include:kotlin-compiler')
    }
}

Git - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations
and full access to internals.
Git is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public
License version 2 (some parts of it are under different licenses,
compatible with the GPLv2). It was originally written by Linus
Torvalds with help of a group of hackers around the net.
Please read the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
Many Git online resources are accessible from https://git-scm.com/
including full documentation and Git related tools.
See Documentation/gittutorial.txt to get started, then see
Documentation/giteveryday.txt for a useful minimum set of commands, and
Documentation/git-.txt for documentation of each command.
If git has been correctly installed, then the tutorial can also be
read with man gittutorial or git help tutorial, and the
documentation of each command with man git-<commandname> or git help <commandname>.
CVS users may also want to read Documentation/gitcvs-migration.txt
(man gitcvs-migration or git help cvs-migration if git is
installed).
The user discussion and development of Git take place on the Git
mailing list -- everyone is welcome to post bug reports, feature
requests, comments and patches to git@vger.kernel.org (read
Documentation/SubmittingPatches for instructions on patch submission).
To subscribe to the list, send an email with just ""subscribe git"" in
the body to majordomo@vger.kernel.org. The mailing list archives are
available at https://public-inbox.org/git/,
http://marc.info/?l=git and other archival sites.
Issues which are security relevant should be disclosed privately to
the Git Security mailing list git-security@googlegroups.com.
The maintainer frequently sends the ""What's cooking"" reports that
list the current status of various development topics to the mailing
list.  The discussion following them give a good reference for
project status, development direction and remaining tasks.
The name ""git"" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very
first version. He described the tool as ""the stupid content tracker""
and the name as (depending on your mood):

random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
mispronunciation of ""get"" may or may not be relevant.

Immutable collections for JavaScript
 
Immutable data cannot be changed once created, leading to much simpler
application development, no defensive copying, and enabling advanced memoization
and change detection techniques with simple logic. Persistent data presents
a mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always
yields new updated data.
Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures including:
List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record.
These data structures are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using
structural sharing via hash maps tries and vector tries as popularized
by Clojure and Scala, minimizing the need to copy or cache data.
Immutable.js also provides a lazy Seq, allowing efficient
chaining of collection methods like map and filter without creating
intermediate representations. Create some Seq with Range and Repeat.
Want to hear more? Watch the presentation about Immutable.js:

Getting started
Install immutable using npm.
npm install immutable
Then require it into any module.
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
map1.get('b') + "" vs. "" + map2.get('b'); // 2 vs. 50
Browser
Immutable.js has no dependencies, which makes it predictable to include in a Browser.
It's highly recommended to use a module bundler like webpack,
rollup, or
browserify. The immutable npm module works
without any additional consideration. All examples throughout the documentation
will assume use of this kind of tool.
Alternatively, Immutable.js may be directly included as a script tag. Download
or link to a CDN such as CDNJS
or jsDelivr.
Use a script tag to directly add Immutable to the global scope:
<script src=""immutable.min.js""></script>
<script>
  var map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
  var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
  map1.get('b'); // 2
  map2.get('b'); // 50
</script>
Or use an AMD-style loader (such as RequireJS):
require(['./immutable.min.js'], function (Immutable) {
  var map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
  var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
  map1.get('b'); // 2
  map2.get('b'); // 50
});
Flow & TypeScript
Use these Immutable collections and sequences as you would use native
collections in your Flowtype or TypeScript programs while still taking
advantage of type generics, error detection, and auto-complete in your IDE.
Installing immutable via npm brings with it type definitions for Flow (v0.55.0 or higher)
and TypeScript (v2.1.0 or higher), so you shouldn't need to do anything at all!
Using TypeScript with Immutable.js v4
Immutable.js type definitions embrace ES2015. While Immutable.js itself supports
legacy browsers and environments, its type definitions require TypeScript's 2015
lib. Include either ""target"": ""es2015"" or ""lib"": ""es2015"" in your
tsconfig.json, or provide --target es2015 or --lib es2015 to the
tsc command.
const { Map } = require(""immutable"");
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
map1.get('b') + "" vs. "" + map2.get('b'); // 2 vs. 50
Using TypeScript with Immutable.js v3 and earlier:
Previous versions of Immutable.js include a reference file which you can include
via relative path to the type definitions at the top of your file.
///<reference path='./node_modules/immutable/dist/immutable.d.ts'/>
import Immutable from require('immutable');
var map1: Immutable.Map<string, number>;
map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
map1.get('b'); // 2
map2.get('b'); // 50
The case for Immutability
Much of what makes application development difficult is tracking mutation and
maintaining state. Developing with immutable data encourages you to think
differently about how data flows through your application.
Subscribing to data events throughout your application creates a huge overhead of
book-keeping which can hurt performance, sometimes dramatically, and creates
opportunities for areas of your application to get out of sync with each other
due to easy to make programmer error. Since immutable data never changes,
subscribing to changes throughout the model is a dead-end and new data can only
ever be passed from above.
This model of data flow aligns well with the architecture of React
and especially well with an application designed using the ideas of Flux.
When data is passed from above rather than being subscribed to, and you're only
interested in doing work when something has changed, you can use equality.
Immutable collections should be treated as values rather than objects. While
objects represent some thing which could change over time, a value represents
the state of that thing at a particular instance of time. This principle is most
important to understanding the appropriate use of immutable data. In order to
treat Immutable.js collections as values, it's important to use the
Immutable.is() function or .equals() method to determine value equality
instead of the === operator which determines object reference identity.
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
map1.equals(map2); // true
map1 === map2; // false
Note: As a performance optimization Immutable.js attempts to return the existing
collection when an operation would result in an identical collection, allowing
for using === reference equality to determine if something definitely has not
changed. This can be extremely useful when used within a memoization function
which would prefer to re-run the function if a deeper equality check could
potentially be more costly. The === equality check is also used internally by
Immutable.is and .equals() as a performance optimization.
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = map1.set('b', 2); // Set to same value
map1 === map2; // true
If an object is immutable, it can be ""copied"" simply by making another reference
to it instead of copying the entire object. Because a reference is much smaller
than the object itself, this results in memory savings and a potential boost in
execution speed for programs which rely on copies (such as an undo-stack).
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const map = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const mapCopy = map; // Look, ""copies"" are free!
JavaScript-first API
While Immutable.js is inspired by Clojure, Scala, Haskell and other functional
programming environments, it's designed to bring these powerful concepts to
JavaScript, and therefore has an Object-Oriented API that closely mirrors that
of ES2015 Array, Map, and Set.
The difference for the immutable collections is that methods which would mutate
the collection, like push, set, unshift or splice, instead return a new
immutable collection. Methods which return new arrays, like slice or concat,
instead return new immutable collections.
const { List } = require('immutable');
const list1 = List([ 1, 2 ]);
const list2 = list1.push(3, 4, 5);
const list3 = list2.unshift(0);
const list4 = list1.concat(list2, list3);
assert.equal(list1.size, 2);
assert.equal(list2.size, 5);
assert.equal(list3.size, 6);
assert.equal(list4.size, 13);
assert.equal(list4.get(0), 1);
Almost all of the methods on Array will be found in similar form on
Immutable.List, those of Map found on Immutable.Map, and those of Set
found on Immutable.Set, including collection operations like forEach()
and map().
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const alpha = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 });
alpha.map((v, k) => k.toUpperCase()).join();
// 'A,B,C,D'
Convert from raw JavaScript objects and arrays.
Designed to inter-operate with your existing JavaScript, Immutable.js
accepts plain JavaScript Arrays and Objects anywhere a method expects a
Collection.
const { Map, List } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 });
const map2 = Map({ c: 10, a: 20, t: 30 });
const obj = { d: 100, o: 200, g: 300 };
const map3 = map1.merge(map2, obj);
// Map { a: 20, b: 2, c: 10, d: 100, t: 30, o: 200, g: 300 }
const list1 = List([ 1, 2, 3 ]);
const list2 = List([ 4, 5, 6 ]);
const array = [ 7, 8, 9 ];
const list3 = list1.concat(list2, array);
// List [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
This is possible because Immutable.js can treat any JavaScript Array or Object
as a Collection. You can take advantage of this in order to get sophisticated
collection methods on JavaScript Objects, which otherwise have a very sparse
native API. Because Seq evaluates lazily and does not cache intermediate
results, these operations can be extremely efficient.
const { Seq } = require('immutable');
const myObject = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
Seq(myObject).map(x => x * x).toObject();
// { a: 1, b: 4, c: 9 }
Keep in mind, when using JS objects to construct Immutable Maps, that
JavaScript Object properties are always strings, even if written in a quote-less
shorthand, while Immutable Maps accept keys of any type.
const { fromJS } = require('immutable');

const obj = { 1: ""one"" };
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // [ ""1"" ]
console.log(obj[""1""], obj[1]); // ""one"", ""one""

const map = fromJS(obj);
console.log(map.get(""1""), map.get(1)); // ""one"", undefined
Property access for JavaScript Objects first converts the key to a string, but
since Immutable Map keys can be of any type the argument to get() is
not altered.
Converts back to raw JavaScript objects.
All Immutable.js Collections can be converted to plain JavaScript Arrays and
Objects shallowly with toArray() and toObject() or deeply with toJS().
All Immutable Collections also implement toJSON() allowing them to be passed
to JSON.stringify directly. They also respect the custom toJSON() methods of
nested objects.
const { Map, List } = require('immutable');
const deep = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: List([ 3, 4, 5 ]) });
console.log(deep.toObject()); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ] }
console.log(deep.toArray()); // [ 1, 2, List [ 3, 4, 5 ] ]
console.log(deep.toJS()); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] }
JSON.stringify(deep); // '{""a"":1,""b"":2,""c"":[3,4,5]}'
Embraces ES2015
Immutable.js supports all JavaScript environments, including legacy
browsers (even IE8). However it also takes advantage of features added to
JavaScript in ES2015, the latest standard version of JavaScript, including
Iterators, Arrow Functions, Classes, and Modules. It's inspired
by the native Map and Set collections added to ES2015.
All examples in the Documentation are presented in ES2015. To run in all
browsers, they need to be translated to ES5.
// ES2015
const mapped = foo.map(x => x * x);
// ES5
var mapped = foo.map(function (x) { return x * x; });
All Immutable.js collections are Iterable, which allows them to be
used anywhere an Iterable is expected, such as when spreading into an Array.
const { List } = require('immutable');
const aList = List([ 1, 2, 3 ]);
const anArray = [ 0, ...aList, 4, 5 ]; // [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
Note: A Collection is always iterated in the same order, however that order may
not always be well defined, as is the case for the Map and Set.
Nested Structures
The collections in Immutable.js are intended to be nested, allowing for deep
trees of data, similar to JSON.
const { fromJS } = require('immutable');
const nested = fromJS({ a: { b: { c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } });
// Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } }
A few power-tools allow for reading and operating on nested data. The
most useful are mergeDeep, getIn, setIn, and updateIn, found on List,
Map and OrderedMap.
const { fromJS } = require('immutable');
const nested = fromJS({ a: { b: { c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } });

const nested2 = nested.mergeDeep({ a: { b: { d: 6 } } });
// Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ], d: 6 } } }

console.log(nested2.getIn([ 'a', 'b', 'd' ])); // 6

const nested3 = nested2.updateIn([ 'a', 'b', 'd' ], value => value + 1);
console.log(nested3);
// Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ], d: 7 } } }

const nested4 = nested3.updateIn([ 'a', 'b', 'c' ], list => list.push(6));
// Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5, 6 ], d: 7 } } }
Equality treats Collections as Values
Immutable.js collections are treated as pure data values. Two immutable
collections are considered value equal (via .equals() or is()) if they
represent the same collection of values. This differs from JavaScript's typical
reference equal (via === or ==) for Objects and Arrays which only
determines if two variables represent references to the same object instance.
Consider the example below where two identical Map instances are not
reference equal but are value equal.
// First consider:
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const obj2 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
obj1 !== obj2; // two different instances are always not equal with ===

const { Map, is } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
map1 !== map2; // two different instances are not reference-equal
map1.equals(map2); // but are value-equal if they have the same values
is(map1, map2); // alternatively can use the is() function
Value equality allows Immutable.js collections to be used as keys in Maps or
values in Sets, and retrieved with different but equivalent collections:
const { Map, Set } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const set = Set().add(map1);
set.has(map2); // true because these are value-equal
Note: is() uses the same measure of equality as Object.is for scalar
strings and numbers, but uses value equality for Immutable collections,
determining if both are immutable and all keys and values are equal
using the same measure of equality.
Performance tradeoffs
While value equality is useful in many circumstances, it has different
performance characteristics than reference equality. Understanding these
tradeoffs may help you decide which to use in each case, especially when used
to memoize some operation.
When comparing two collections, value equality may require considering every
item in each collection, on an O(N) time complexity. For large collections of
values, this could become a costly operation. Though if the two are not equal
and hardly similar, the inequality is determined very quickly. In contrast, when
comparing two collections with reference equality, only the initial references
to memory need to be compared which is not based on the size of the collections,
which has an O(1) time complexity. Checking reference equality is always very
fast, however just because two collections are not reference-equal does not rule
out the possibility that they may be value-equal.
Return self on no-op optimization
When possible, Immutable.js avoids creating new objects for updates where no
change in value occurred, to allow for efficient reference equality checking
to quickly determine if no change occurred.
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const originalMap = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const updatedMap = originalMap.set('b', 2);
updatedMap === originalMap; // No-op .set() returned the original reference.
However updates which do result in a change will return a new reference. Each
of these operations occur independently, so two similar updates will not return
the same reference:
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const originalMap = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const updatedMap = originalMap.set('b', 1000);
// New instance, leaving the original immutable.
updatedMap !== originalMap;
const anotherUpdatedMap = originalMap.set('b', 1000);
// Despite both the results of the same operation, each created a new reference.
anotherUpdatedMap !== updatedMap;
// However the two are value equal.
anotherUpdatedMap.equals(updatedMap);
Batching Mutations

If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound?
If a pure function mutates some local data in order to produce an immutable
return value, is that ok?
— Rich Hickey, Clojure

Applying a mutation to create a new immutable object results in some overhead,
which can add up to a minor performance penalty. If you need to apply a series
of mutations locally before returning, Immutable.js gives you the ability to
create a temporary mutable (transient) copy of a collection and apply a batch of
mutations in a performant manner by using withMutations. In fact, this is
exactly how  Immutable.js applies complex mutations itself.
As an example, building list2 results in the creation of 1, not 3, new
immutable Lists.
const { List } = require('immutable');
const list1 = List([ 1, 2, 3 ]);
const list2 = list1.withMutations(function (list) {
  list.push(4).push(5).push(6);
});
assert.equal(list1.size, 3);
assert.equal(list2.size, 6);
Note: Immutable.js also provides asMutable and asImmutable, but only
encourages their use when withMutations will not suffice. Use caution to not
return a mutable copy, which could result in undesired behavior.
Important!: Only a select few methods can be used in withMutations including
set, push and pop. These methods can be applied directly against a
persistent data-structure where other methods like map, filter, sort,
and splice will always return new immutable data-structures and never mutate
a mutable collection.
Lazy Seq
Seq describes a lazy operation, allowing them to efficiently chain
use of all the higher-order collection methods (such as map and filter)
by not creating intermediate collections.
Seq is immutable — Once a Seq is created, it cannot be
changed, appended to, rearranged or otherwise modified. Instead, any mutative
method called on a Seq will return a new Seq.
Seq is lazy — Seq does as little work as necessary to respond to any
method call. Values are often created during iteration, including implicit
iteration when reducing or converting to a concrete data structure such as
a List or JavaScript Array.
For example, the following performs no work, because the resulting
Seq's values are never iterated:
const { Seq } = require('immutable');
const oddSquares = Seq([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ])
  .filter(x => x % 2 !== 0)
  .map(x => x * x);
Once the Seq is used, it performs only the work necessary. In this
example, no intermediate arrays are ever created, filter is called three
times, and map is only called once:
oddSquares.get(1); // 9
Any collection can be converted to a lazy Seq with Seq().
const { Map, Seq } = require('immutable');
const map = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const lazySeq = Seq(map);
Seq allows for the efficient chaining of operations, allowing for the
expression of logic that can otherwise be very tedious:
lazySeq
  .flip()
  .map(key => key.toUpperCase())
  .flip();
// Seq { A: 1, B: 2, C: 3 }
As well as expressing logic that would otherwise seem memory or time
limited, for example Range is a special kind of Lazy sequence.
const { Range } = require('immutable');
Range(1, Infinity)
  .skip(1000)
  .map(n => -n)
  .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)
  .take(2)
  .reduce((r, n) => r * n, 1);

前言
README in English
初学vue时曾在网上搜索vue的实战项目源码，无奈大部分都是简单的demo，对于深究vue没有太大的帮助，剩下的一些大部分都是像音乐播放器之类的展示型项目，交互没有预期那么复杂。但我们实际在工作中，经常会遇到有购物车的项目，这类项目因为涉及到money，所以对逻辑严谨度要求高，页面之间交互复杂，又会伴随着登录、注册、用户信息等等，常常会让我们很头疼。既然还没人用vue写过这样的项目，那不如我来写，开源出来对能看到的人也会有帮助。
这种功能性的项目很实用但是往往也很枯燥，没有音乐播放器那么看起来绚丽，思来想去发现饿了么是一个不错的素材，一来它足够复杂，开放的外卖平台比一般的公司独有商店更加复杂。二来 见到那么多美食，大家也不会感觉到厌烦。
为啥是饿了么，而不是百度，美团？原因很简单，三个外卖大佬里，饿了么的色调和布局是最漂亮的，看起来最舒服。
此项目大大小小共 45 个页面，涉及注册、登录、商品展示、购物车、下单等等，是一个完整的流程。一般公司即便是官网的单页面项目都没这么复杂，如果这个项目能驾驭的了，相信大部分公司的其他单页面应用也就不在话下，即便更复杂，也不会比这个高到哪里去。
因为利用业余时间来做，年前就开始写，又跨个年，周期有点长，项目从零布局到完成共用了2个多月的时间，目前项目已经完成，正在进行一些性能的优化，增加详细的注释。
另外，这个项目和慕课网视频的那个饿了么没有任何关系，慕课网的项目只有一个页面，我在看完vue的官方文档后直接写了这个项目，没有参照任何人的代码，请大家不要混为一谈。
注：此项目纯属个人瞎搞，正常下单请选择饿了么官方客户端。

1、因为并不是elm官方，而且因为要开代理，必须在pc端打开，最多只能做到下单这一步，下单成功后可以在手机客户端查看并付款。
2、一般涉及到money的网页逻辑都比较复杂，尤其像饿了么这样一个开放的平台，商家和食品种类繁多，页面与页面之间交互复杂，在写到 购物车 和 下单 功能时众多的数据和逻辑一度让人很头疼，又没有设计和接口api文档，只能一步步摸索。
3、vue因其轻量级的框架在中小型项目中表现亮眼，在大型单页面应用中因为vuex的存在，表现依然出色，在处理复杂交互逻辑的时候，vuex的存在是不可或缺的。所以说利用 vue + vuex 完全可以去做大型的单页面项目。
4、项目写到现在，从 登录注册到、首页、搜索、商家列表、购物车、下单、订单列表、个人中心 一个流程走完之后、不但对vue的理解更深一层，而且对以后掌控大型项目的时候也有非常多的帮助，做一个实际的项目才能对自己有很大的提升。
5、曾一度怀疑，花几个月的时间做这样一个项目到底有没有意义，本来只是想做一个小项目练练手，没想到后来越写越多，不过坚持下来后我相信一切都是值得的。
6、项目已经完成，共45个页面。
最终目标
1、用node.js构建一个模拟外卖平台的后台系统。地址在这里
2、写出跨 Android 和 IOS 的原生APP版本。地址在这里
3、如果时间来的及，会出一卖家版本。
所以我的目的是构建一个横跨前后端，移动IOS、Android的完整生态圈。

Installation
To install Gin package, you need to install Go and set your Go workspace first.

The first need Go installed (version 1.8+ is required), then you can use the below Go command to install Gin.

$ go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin

Import it in your code:

import ""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""

(Optional) Import net/http. This is required for example if using constants such as http.StatusOK.

import ""net/http""
Use a vendor tool like Govendor

go get govendor

$ go get github.com/kardianos/govendor

Create your project folder and cd inside

$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/myusername/project && cd ""$_""

Vendor init your project and add gin

$ govendor init
$ govendor fetch github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.3

Copy a starting template inside your project

$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gin-gonic/examples/master/basic/main.go > main.go

Run your project

$ go run main.go
Prerequisite
Now Gin requires Go 1.8 or later and Go 1.10 will be required next major version.
Quick start
# assume the following codes in example.go file
$ cat example.go
package main

import ""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(200, gin.H{
			""message"": ""pong"",
		})
	})
	r.Run() // listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
}
# run example.go and visit 0.0.0.0:8080/ping on browser
$ go run example.go

(1): Total Repetitions achieved in constant time, higher means more confident result
(2): Single Repetition Duration (ns/op), lower is better
(3): Heap Memory (B/op), lower is better
(4): Average Allocations per Repetition (allocs/op), lower is better

Gin v1. stable

 Zero allocation router.
 Still the fastest http router and framework. From routing to writing.
 Complete suite of unit tests
 Battle tested
 API frozen, new releases will not break your code.

Build with jsoniter
Gin uses encoding/json as default json package but you can change to jsoniter by build from other tags.
$ go build -tags=jsoniter .
API Examples
You can find a number of ready-to-run examples at Gin examples repository.
Using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS
func main() {
	// Creates a gin router with default middleware:
	// logger and recovery (crash-free) middleware
	router := gin.Default()

	router.GET(""/someGet"", getting)
	router.POST(""/somePost"", posting)
	router.PUT(""/somePut"", putting)
	router.DELETE(""/someDelete"", deleting)
	router.PATCH(""/somePatch"", patching)
	router.HEAD(""/someHead"", head)
	router.OPTIONS(""/someOptions"", options)

	// By default it serves on :8080 unless a
	// PORT environment variable was defined.
	router.Run()
	// router.Run("":3000"") for a hard coded port
}
Parameters in path
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	// This handler will match /user/john but will not match /user/ or /user
	router.GET(""/user/:name"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		name := c.Param(""name"")
		c.String(http.StatusOK, ""Hello %s"", name)
	})

	// However, this one will match /user/john/ and also /user/john/send
	// If no other routers match /user/john, it will redirect to /user/john/
	router.GET(""/user/:name/*action"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		name := c.Param(""name"")
		action := c.Param(""action"")
		message := name + "" is "" + action
		c.String(http.StatusOK, message)
	})

	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Querystring parameters
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	// Query string parameters are parsed using the existing underlying request object.
	// The request responds to a url matching:  /welcome?firstname=Jane&lastname=Doe
	router.GET(""/welcome"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		firstname := c.DefaultQuery(""firstname"", ""Guest"")
		lastname := c.Query(""lastname"") // shortcut for c.Request.URL.Query().Get(""lastname"")

		c.String(http.StatusOK, ""Hello %s %s"", firstname, lastname)
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Multipart/Urlencoded Form
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	router.POST(""/form_post"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		message := c.PostForm(""message"")
		nick := c.DefaultPostForm(""nick"", ""anonymous"")

		c.JSON(200, gin.H{
			""status"":  ""posted"",
			""message"": message,
			""nick"":    nick,
		})
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Another example: query + post form
POST /post?id=1234&page=1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=manu&message=this_is_great

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	router.POST(""/post"", func(c *gin.Context) {

		id := c.Query(""id"")
		page := c.DefaultQuery(""page"", ""0"")
		name := c.PostForm(""name"")
		message := c.PostForm(""message"")

		fmt.Printf(""id: %s; page: %s; name: %s; message: %s"", id, page, name, message)
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
id: 1234; page: 1; name: manu; message: this_is_great

Map as querystring or postform parameters
POST /post?ids[a]=1234&ids[b]=hello HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

names[first]=thinkerou&names[second]=tianou

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	router.POST(""/post"", func(c *gin.Context) {

		ids := c.QueryMap(""ids"")
		names := c.PostFormMap(""names"")

		fmt.Printf(""ids: %v; names: %v"", ids, names)
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
ids: map[b:hello a:1234], names: map[second:tianou first:thinkerou]

Upload files
Single file
References issue #774 and detail example code.
file.Filename SHOULD NOT be trusted. See Content-Disposition on MDN and #1693

The filename is always optional and must not be used blindly by the application: path information should be stripped, and conversion to the server file system rules should be done.

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	// Set a lower memory limit for multipart forms (default is 32 MiB)
	// router.MaxMultipartMemory = 8 << 20  // 8 MiB
	router.POST(""/upload"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// single file
		file, _ := c.FormFile(""file"")
		log.Println(file.Filename)

		// Upload the file to specific dst.
		// c.SaveUploadedFile(file, dst)

		c.String(http.StatusOK, fmt.Sprintf(""'%s' uploaded!"", file.Filename))
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
How to curl:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/upload \
  -F ""file=@/Users/appleboy/test.zip"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: multipart/form-data""
Multiple files
See the detail example code.
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	// Set a lower memory limit for multipart forms (default is 32 MiB)
	// router.MaxMultipartMemory = 8 << 20  // 8 MiB
	router.POST(""/upload"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// Multipart form
		form, _ := c.MultipartForm()
		files := form.File[""upload[]""]

		for _, file := range files {
			log.Println(file.Filename)

			// Upload the file to specific dst.
			// c.SaveUploadedFile(file, dst)
		}
		c.String(http.StatusOK, fmt.Sprintf(""%d files uploaded!"", len(files)))
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
How to curl:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/upload \
  -F ""upload[]=@/Users/appleboy/test1.zip"" \
  -F ""upload[]=@/Users/appleboy/test2.zip"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: multipart/form-data""
Grouping routes

Blank Gin without middleware by default
Use
r := gin.New()
instead of
// Default With the Logger and Recovery middleware already attached
r := gin.Default()
Using middleware
func main() {
	// Creates a router without any middleware by default
	r := gin.New()

	// Global middleware
	// Logger middleware will write the logs to gin.DefaultWriter even if you set with GIN_MODE=release.
	// By default gin.DefaultWriter = os.Stdout
	r.Use(gin.Logger())

	// Recovery middleware recovers from any panics and writes a 500 if there was one.
	r.Use(gin.Recovery())

	// Per route middleware, you can add as many as you desire.
	r.GET(""/benchmark"", MyBenchLogger(), benchEndpoint)

	// Authorization group
	// authorized := r.Group(""/"", AuthRequired())
	// exactly the same as:
	authorized := r.Group(""/"")
	// per group middleware! in this case we use the custom created
	// AuthRequired() middleware just in the ""authorized"" group.
	authorized.Use(AuthRequired())
	{
		authorized.POST(""/login"", loginEndpoint)
		authorized.POST(""/submit"", submitEndpoint)
		authorized.POST(""/read"", readEndpoint)

		// nested group
		testing := authorized.Group(""testing"")
		testing.GET(""/analytics"", analyticsEndpoint)
	}

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
How to write log file
func main() {
    // Disable Console Color, you don't need console color when writing the logs to file.
    gin.DisableConsoleColor()

    // Logging to a file.
    f, _ := os.Create(""gin.log"")
    gin.DefaultWriter = io.MultiWriter(f)

    // Use the following code if you need to write the logs to file and console at the same time.
    // gin.DefaultWriter = io.MultiWriter(f, os.Stdout)

    router := gin.Default()
    router.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, ""pong"")
    })

    router.Run("":8080"")
}
Custom Log Format
func main() {
	router := gin.New()

	// LoggerWithFormatter middleware will write the logs to gin.DefaultWriter
	// By default gin.DefaultWriter = os.Stdout
	router.Use(gin.LoggerWithFormatter(func(param gin.LogFormatterParams) string {

		// your custom format
		return fmt.Sprintf(""%s - [%s] \""%s %s %s %d %s \""%s\"" %s\""\n"",
				param.ClientIP,
				param.TimeStamp.Format(time.RFC1123),
				param.Method,
				param.Path,
				param.Request.Proto,
				param.StatusCode,
				param.Latency,
				param.Request.UserAgent(),
				param.ErrorMessage,
		)
	}))
	router.Use(gin.Recovery())

	router.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.String(200, ""pong"")
	})

	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Sample Output
::1 - [Fri, 07 Dec 2018 17:04:38 JST] ""GET /ping HTTP/1.1 200 122.767µs ""Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/71.0.3578.80 Safari/537.36"" ""

Controlling Log output coloring
By default, logs output on console should be colorized depending on the detected TTY.
Never colorize logs:
func main() {
    // Disable log's color
    gin.DisableConsoleColor()
    
    // Creates a gin router with default middleware:
    // logger and recovery (crash-free) middleware
    router := gin.Default()
    
    router.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, ""pong"")
    })
    
    router.Run("":8080"")
}
Always colorize logs:
func main() {
    // Force log's color
    gin.ForceConsoleColor()
    
    // Creates a gin router with default middleware:
    // logger and recovery (crash-free) middleware
    router := gin.Default()
    
    router.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, ""pong"")
    })
    
    router.Run("":8080"")
}
Model binding and validation
To bind a request body into a type, use model binding. We currently support binding of JSON, XML, YAML and standard form values (foo=bar&boo=baz).
Gin uses go-playground/validator.v8 for validation. Check the full docs on tags usage here.
Note that you need to set the corresponding binding tag on all fields you want to bind. For example, when binding from JSON, set json:""fieldname"".
Also, Gin provides two sets of methods for binding:

Type - Must bind

Methods - Bind, BindJSON, BindXML, BindQuery, BindYAML
Behavior - These methods use MustBindWith under the hood. If there is a binding error, the request is aborted with c.AbortWithError(400, err).SetType(ErrorTypeBind). This sets the response status code to 400 and the Content-Type header is set to text/plain; charset=utf-8. Note that if you try to set the response code after this, it will result in a warning [GIN-debug] [WARNING] Headers were already written. Wanted to override status code 400 with 422. If you wish to have greater control over the behavior, consider using the ShouldBind equivalent method.


Type - Should bind

Methods - ShouldBind, ShouldBindJSON, ShouldBindXML, ShouldBindQuery, ShouldBindYAML
Behavior - These methods use ShouldBindWith under the hood. If there is a binding error, the error is returned and it is the developer's responsibility to handle the request and error appropriately.



When using the Bind-method, Gin tries to infer the binder depending on the Content-Type header. If you are sure what you are binding, you can use MustBindWith or ShouldBindWith.
You can also specify that specific fields are required. If a field is decorated with binding:""required"" and has a empty value when binding, an error will be returned.
// Binding from JSON
type Login struct {
	User     string `form:""user"" json:""user"" xml:""user""  binding:""required""`
	Password string `form:""password"" json:""password"" xml:""password"" binding:""required""`
}

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	// Example for binding JSON ({""user"": ""manu"", ""password"": ""123""})
	router.POST(""/loginJSON"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		var json Login
		if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&json); err != nil {
			c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{""error"": err.Error()})
			return
		}
		
		if json.User != ""manu"" || json.Password != ""123"" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{""status"": ""unauthorized""})
			return
		} 
		
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""status"": ""you are logged in""})
	})

	// Example for binding XML (
	//	<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
	//	<root>
	//		<user>user</user>
	//		<password>123</password>
	//	</root>)
	router.POST(""/loginXML"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		var xml Login
		if err := c.ShouldBindXML(&xml); err != nil {
			c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{""error"": err.Error()})
			return
		}
		
		if xml.User != ""manu"" || xml.Password != ""123"" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{""status"": ""unauthorized""})
			return
		} 
		
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""status"": ""you are logged in""})
	})

	// Example for binding a HTML form (user=manu&password=123)
	router.POST(""/loginForm"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		var form Login
		// This will infer what binder to use depending on the content-type header.
		if err := c.ShouldBind(&form); err != nil {
			c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{""error"": err.Error()})
			return
		}
		
		if form.User != ""manu"" || form.Password != ""123"" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{""status"": ""unauthorized""})
			return
		} 
		
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""status"": ""you are logged in""})
	})

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Sample request
$ curl -v -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/loginJSON \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{ ""user"": ""manu"" }'
> POST /loginJSON HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.51.0
> Accept: */*
> content-type: application/json

< Content-Length: 100
<
{""error"":""Key: 'Login.Password' Error:Field validation for 'Password' failed on the 'required' tag""}
Skip validate
When running the above example using the above the curl command, it returns error. Because the example use binding:""required"" for Password. If use binding:""-"" for Password, then it will not return error when running the above example again.
Custom Validators
It is also possible to register custom validators. See the example code.

		}

		c.DataFromReader(http.StatusOK, contentLength, contentType, reader, extraHeaders)
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
HTML rendering
Using LoadHTMLGlob() or LoadHTMLFiles()
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	router.LoadHTMLGlob(""templates/*"")
	//router.LoadHTMLFiles(""templates/template1.html"", ""templates/template2.html"")
	router.GET(""/index"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.HTML(http.StatusOK, ""index.tmpl"", gin.H{
			""title"": ""Main website"",
		})
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
templates/index.tmpl
<html>
	<h1>
		{{ .title }}
	</h1>
</html>
Using templates with same name in different directories
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	router.LoadHTMLGlob(""templates/**/*"")
	router.GET(""/posts/index"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.HTML(http.StatusOK, ""posts/index.tmpl"", gin.H{
			""title"": ""Posts"",
		})
	})
	router.GET(""/users/index"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.HTML(http.StatusOK, ""users/index.tmpl"", gin.H{
			""title"": ""Users"",
		})
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
templates/posts/index.tmpl
{{ define ""posts/index.tmpl"" }}
<html><h1>
	{{ .title }}
</h1>
<p>Using posts/index.tmpl</p>
</html>
{{ end }}
templates/users/index.tmpl
{{ define ""users/index.tmpl"" }}
<html><h1>
	{{ .title }}
</h1>
<p>Using users/index.tmpl</p>
</html>
{{ end }}
Custom Template renderer
You can also use your own html template render
import ""html/template""

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	html := template.Must(template.ParseFiles(""file1"", ""file2""))
	router.SetHTMLTemplate(html)
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Custom Delimiters
You may use custom delims
	r := gin.Default()
	r.Delims(""{[{"", ""}]}"")
	r.LoadHTMLGlob(""/path/to/templates"")
Custom Template Funcs
See the detail example code.
main.go
import (
    ""fmt""
    ""html/template""
    ""net/http""
    ""time""

    ""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

func formatAsDate(t time.Time) string {
    year, month, day := t.Date()
    return fmt.Sprintf(""%d%02d/%02d"", year, month, day)
}

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()
    router.Delims(""{[{"", ""}]}"")
    router.SetFuncMap(template.FuncMap{
        ""formatAsDate"": formatAsDate,
    })
    router.LoadHTMLFiles(""./testdata/template/raw.tmpl"")

    router.GET(""/raw"", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.HTML(http.StatusOK, ""raw.tmpl"", map[string]interface{}{
            ""now"": time.Date(2017, 07, 01, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC),
        })
    })

    router.Run("":8080"")
}

raw.tmpl
Date: {[{.now | formatAsDate}]}
Result:
Date: 2017/07/01

Multitemplate
Gin allow by default use only one html.Template. Check a multitemplate render for using features like go 1.6 block template.
Redirects
Issuing a HTTP redirect is easy. Both internal and external locations are supported.
r.GET(""/test"", func(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Redirect(http.StatusMovedPermanently, ""http://www.google.com/"")
})
Issuing a Router redirect, use HandleContext like below.
r.GET(""/test"", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.Request.URL.Path = ""/test2""
    r.HandleContext(c)
})
r.GET(""/test2"", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{""hello"": ""world""})
})
Custom Middleware
func Logger() gin.HandlerFunc {
	return func(c *gin.Context) {
		t := time.Now()

		// Set example variable
		c.Set(""example"", ""12345"")

		// before request

		c.Next()

		// after request
		latency := time.Since(t)
		log.Print(latency)

		// access the status we are sending
		status := c.Writer.Status()
		log.Println(status)
	}
}

func main() {
	r := gin.New()
	r.Use(Logger())

	r.GET(""/test"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		example := c.MustGet(""example"").(string)

		// it would print: ""12345""
		log.Println(example)
	})

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
Using BasicAuth() middleware
// simulate some private data
var secrets = gin.H{
	""foo"":    gin.H{""email"": ""foo@bar.com"", ""phone"": ""123433""},
	""austin"": gin.H{""email"": ""austin@example.com"", ""phone"": ""666""},
	""lena"":   gin.H{""email"": ""lena@guapa.com"", ""phone"": ""523443""},
}

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	// Group using gin.BasicAuth() middleware
	// gin.Accounts is a shortcut for map[string]string
	authorized := r.Group(""/admin"", gin.BasicAuth(gin.Accounts{
		""foo"":    ""bar"",
		""austin"": ""1234"",
		""lena"":   ""hello2"",
		""manu"":   ""4321"",
	}))

	// /admin/secrets endpoint
	// hit ""localhost:8080/admin/secrets
	authorized.GET(""/secrets"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// get user, it was set by the BasicAuth middleware
		user := c.MustGet(gin.AuthUserKey).(string)
		if secret, ok := secrets[user]; ok {
			c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""user"": user, ""secret"": secret})
		} else {
			c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""user"": user, ""secret"": ""NO SECRET :(""})
		}
	})

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
Goroutines inside a middleware
When starting new Goroutines inside a middleware or handler, you SHOULD NOT use the original context inside it, you have to use a read-only copy.
func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	r.GET(""/long_async"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// create copy to be used inside the goroutine
		cCp := c.Copy()
		go func() {
			// simulate a long task with time.Sleep(). 5 seconds
			time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)

			// note that you are using the copied context ""cCp"", IMPORTANT
			log.Println(""Done! in path "" + cCp.Request.URL.Path)
		}()
	})

	r.GET(""/long_sync"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// simulate a long task with time.Sleep(). 5 seconds
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)

		// since we are NOT using a goroutine, we do not have to copy the context
		log.Println(""Done! in path "" + c.Request.URL.Path)
	})

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
Custom HTTP configuration
Use http.ListenAndServe() directly, like this:
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	http.ListenAndServe("":8080"", router)
}
or
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	s := &http.Server{
		Addr:           "":8080"",
		Handler:        router,
		ReadTimeout:    10 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
		MaxHeaderBytes: 1 << 20,
	}
	s.ListenAndServe()
}
Support Let's Encrypt
example for 1-line LetsEncrypt HTTPS servers.
package main

import (
	""log""

	""github.com/gin-gonic/autotls""
	""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	// Ping handler
	r.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.String(200, ""pong"")
	})

	log.Fatal(autotls.Run(r, ""example1.com"", ""example2.com""))
}
example for custom autocert manager.
package main

)

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	// Ping handler
	r.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.String(200, ""pong"")
	})

	m := autocert.Manager{
		Prompt:     autocert.AcceptTOS,
		HostPolicy: autocert.HostWhitelist(""example1.com"", ""example2.com""),
		Cache:      autocert.DirCache(""/var/www/.cache""),
	}

	log.Fatal(autotls.RunWithManager(r, &m))
}
Run multiple service using Gin
See the question and try the following example:
package main

import (
	""log""
	""net/http""
	""time""

	""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
	""golang.org/x/sync/errgroup""
)

var (
	g errgroup.Group
)

func router01() http.Handler {
	e := gin.New()
	e.Use(gin.Recovery())
	e.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(
			http.StatusOK,
			gin.H{
				""code"":  http.StatusOK,
				""error"": ""Welcome server 01"",
			},
		)
	})

	return e
}

func router02() http.Handler {
	e := gin.New()
	e.Use(gin.Recovery())
	e.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(
			http.StatusOK,
			gin.H{
				""code"":  http.StatusOK,
				""error"": ""Welcome server 02"",
			},
		)
	})

	return e
}

func main() {
	server01 := &http.Server{
		Addr:         "":8080"",
		Handler:      router01(),
		ReadTimeout:  5 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
	}

	server02 := &http.Server{
		Addr:         "":8081"",
		Handler:      router02(),
		ReadTimeout:  5 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
	}

	g.Go(func() error {
		return server01.ListenAndServe()
	})

	g.Go(func() error {
		return server02.ListenAndServe()
	})

	if err := g.Wait(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
Graceful restart or stop
Do you want to graceful restart or stop your web server?
There are some ways this can be done.
We can use fvbock/endless to replace the default ListenAndServe. Refer issue #296 for more details.
router := gin.Default()
router.GET(""/"", handler)
// [...]
endless.ListenAndServe("":4242"", router)
An alternative to endless:

manners: A polite Go HTTP server that shuts down gracefully.
graceful: Graceful is a Go package enabling graceful shutdown of an http.Handler server.
grace: Graceful restart & zero downtime deploy for Go servers.

If you are using Go 1.8, you may not need to use this library! Consider using http.Server's built-in Shutdown() method for graceful shutdowns. See the full graceful-shutdown example with gin.
// +build go1.8

package main

import (
	""context""
	""log""
	""net/http""
	""os""
	""os/signal""
	""syscall""
	""time""

	""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	router.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
		c.String(http.StatusOK, ""Welcome Gin Server"")
	})

	srv := &http.Server{
		Addr:    "":8080"",
		Handler: router,
	}

	go func() {
		// service connections
		if err := srv.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf(""listen: %s\n"", err)
		}
	}()

	// Wait for interrupt signal to gracefully shutdown the server with
	// a timeout of 5 seconds.
	quit := make(chan os.Signal)
	// kill (no param) default send syscall.SIGTERM
	// kill -2 is syscall.SIGINT
	// kill -9 is syscall.SIGKILL but can""t be catch, so don't need add it
	signal.Notify(quit, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
	<-quit
	log.Println(""Shutdown Server ..."")

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
	defer cancel()
	if err := srv.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(""Server Shutdown:"", err)
	}
	// catching ctx.Done(). timeout of 5 seconds.
	select {
	case <-ctx.Done():
		log.Println(""timeout of 5 seconds."")
	}
	log.Println(""Server exiting"")
}
Build a single binary with templates
You can build a server into a single binary containing templates by using go-assets.
func main() {
	r := gin.New()

	t, err := loadTemplate()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	r.SetHTMLTemplate(t)

	r.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.HTML(http.StatusOK, ""/html/index.tmpl"",nil)
	})
	r.Run("":8080"")
}

// loadTemplate loads templates embedded by go-assets-builder
func loadTemplate() (*template.Template, error) {
	t := template.New("""")
	for name, file := range Assets.Files {
		if file.IsDir() || !strings.HasSuffix(name, "".tmpl"") {
			continue
		}
		h, err := ioutil.ReadAll(file)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		t, err = t.New(name).Parse(string(h))
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
	}
	return t, nil
}
See a complete example in the https://github.com/gin-gonic/examples/tree/master/assets-in-binary directory.
Bind form-data request with custom struct
The follow example using custom struct:
type StructA struct {
    FieldA string `form:""field_a""`
}

type StructB struct {
    NestedStruct StructA
    FieldB string `form:""field_b""`
}

type StructC struct {
    NestedStructPointer *StructA
    FieldC string `form:""field_c""`
}

type StructD struct {
    NestedAnonyStruct struct {
        FieldX string `form:""field_x""`
    }
    FieldD string `form:""field_d""`
}

func GetDataB(c *gin.Context) {
    var b StructB
    c.Bind(&b)
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{
        ""a"": b.NestedStruct,
        ""b"": b.FieldB,
    })
}

func GetDataC(c *gin.Context) {
    var b StructC
    c.Bind(&b)
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{
        ""a"": b.NestedStructPointer,
        ""c"": b.FieldC,
    })
}

func GetDataD(c *gin.Context) {
    var b StructD
    c.Bind(&b)
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{
        ""x"": b.NestedAnonyStruct,
        ""d"": b.FieldD,
    })
}

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET(""/getb"", GetDataB)
    r.GET(""/getc"", GetDataC)
    r.GET(""/getd"", GetDataD)

    r.Run()
}
Using the command curl command result:
$ curl ""http://localhost:8080/getb?field_a=hello&field_b=world""
{""a"":{""FieldA"":""hello""},""b"":""world""}
$ curl ""http://localhost:8080/getc?field_a=hello&field_c=world""
{""a"":{""FieldA"":""hello""},""c"":""world""}
$ curl ""http://localhost:8080/getd?field_x=hello&field_d=world""
{""d"":""world"",""x"":{""FieldX"":""hello""}}

Try to bind body into different structs
The normal methods for binding request body consumes c.Request.Body and they
cannot be called multiple times.
type formA struct {
  Foo string `json:""foo"" xml:""foo"" binding:""required""`
}

type formB struct {
  Bar string `json:""bar"" xml:""bar"" binding:""required""`
}

func SomeHandler(c *gin.Context) {
  objA := formA{}
  objB := formB{}
  // This c.ShouldBind consumes c.Request.Body and it cannot be reused.
  if errA := c.ShouldBind(&objA); errA == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formA`)
  // Always an error is occurred by this because c.Request.Body is EOF now.
  } else if errB := c.ShouldBind(&objB); errB == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formB`)
  } else {
    ...
  }
}
For this, you can use c.ShouldBindBodyWith.
func SomeHandler(c *gin.Context) {
  objA := formA{}
  objB := formB{}
  // This reads c.Request.Body and stores the result into the context.
  if errA := c.ShouldBindBodyWith(&objA, binding.JSON); errA == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formA`)
  // At this time, it reuses body stored in the context.
  } else if errB := c.ShouldBindBodyWith(&objB, binding.JSON); errB == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formB JSON`)
  // And it can accepts other formats
  } else if errB2 := c.ShouldBindBodyWith(&objB, binding.XML); errB2 == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formB XML`)
  } else {
    ...
  }
}

c.ShouldBindBodyWith stores body into the context before binding. This has
a slight impact to performance, so you should not use this method if you are
enough to call binding at once.
This feature is only needed for some formats -- JSON, XML, MsgPack,
ProtoBuf. For other formats, Query, Form, FormPost, FormMultipart,
can be called by c.ShouldBind() multiple times without any damage to
performance (See #1341).

http2 server push
http.Pusher is supported only go1.8+. See the golang blog for detail information.
package main

import (
	""html/template""
	""log""

	""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

var html = template.Must(template.New(""https"").Parse(`
<html>
<head>
  <title>Https Test</title>
  <script src=""/assets/app.js""></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style=""color:red;"">Welcome, Ginner!</h1>
</body>
</html>
`))

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.Static(""/assets"", ""./assets"")
	r.SetHTMLTemplate(html)

	r.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		if pusher := c.Writer.Pusher(); pusher != nil {
			// use pusher.Push() to do server push
			if err := pusher.Push(""/assets/app.js"", nil); err != nil {
				log.Printf(""Failed to push: %v"", err)
			}
		}
		c.HTML(200, ""https"", gin.H{
			""status"": ""success"",
		})
	})

	// Listen and Server in https://127.0.0.1:8080
	r.RunTLS("":8080"", ""./testdata/server.pem"", ""./testdata/server.key"")
}
Define format for the log of routes
The default log of routes is:
[GIN-debug] POST   /foo                      --> main.main.func1 (3 handlers)
[GIN-debug] GET    /bar                      --> main.main.func2 (3 handlers)
[GIN-debug] GET    /status                   --> main.main.func3 (3 handlers)

If you want to log this information in given format (e.g. JSON, key values or something else), then you can define this format with gin.DebugPrintRouteFunc.
In the example below, we log all routes with standard log package but you can use another log tools that suits of your needs.
import (
	""log""
	""net/http""

	""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	gin.DebugPrintRouteFunc = func(httpMethod, absolutePath, handlerName string, nuHandlers int) {
		log.Printf(""endpoint %v %v %v %v\n"", httpMethod, absolutePath, handlerName, nuHandlers)
	}

	r.POST(""/foo"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, ""foo"")
	})

	r.GET(""/bar"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, ""bar"")
	})

	r.GET(""/status"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, ""ok"")
	})

	// Listen and Server in http://0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run()
}
Set and get a cookie
import (
    ""fmt""

    ""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

func main() {

    router := gin.Default()

    router.GET(""/cookie"", func(c *gin.Context) {

        cookie, err := c.Cookie(""gin_cookie"")

        if err != nil {
            cookie = ""NotSet""
            c.SetCookie(""gin_cookie"", ""test"", 3600, ""/"", ""localhost"", false, true)
        }

        fmt.Printf(""Cookie value: %s \n"", cookie)
    })

    router.Run()
}
Testing
The net/http/httptest package is preferable way for HTTP testing.
package main

func setupRouter() *gin.Engine {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.String(200, ""pong"")
	})
	return r
}

func main() {
	r := setupRouter()
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
Test for code example above:
package main

import (
	""net/http""
	""net/http/httptest""
	""testing""

	""github.com/stretchr/testify/assert""
)

func TestPingRoute(t *testing.T) {
	router := setupRouter()

	w := httptest.NewRecorder()
	req, _ := http.NewRequest(""GET"", ""/ping"", nil)
	router.ServeHTTP(w, req)

	assert.Equal(t, 200, w.Code)
	assert.Equal(t, ""pong"", w.Body.String())
}

Slate helps you create beautiful, intelligent, responsive API documentation.

The example above was created with Slate. Check it out at lord.github.io/slate.
Features


Clean, intuitive design — With Slate, the description of your API is on the left side of your documentation, and all the code examples are on the right side. Inspired by Stripe's and PayPal's API docs. Slate is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even in print.


Everything on a single page — Gone are the days when your users had to search through a million pages to find what they wanted. Slate puts the entire documentation on a single page. We haven't sacrificed linkability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.


Slate is just Markdown — When you write docs with Slate, you're just writing Markdown, which makes it simple to edit and understand. Everything is written in Markdown — even the code samples are just Markdown code blocks.


Write code samples in multiple languages — If your API has bindings in multiple programming languages, you can easily put in tabs to switch between them. In your document, you'll distinguish different languages by specifying the language name at the top of each code block, just like with GitHub Flavored Markdown.


Out-of-the-box syntax highlighting for over 100 languages, no configuration required.


Automatic, smoothly scrolling table of contents on the far left of the page. As you scroll, it displays your current position in the document. It's fast, too. We're using Slate at TripIt to build documentation for our new API, where our table of contents has over 180 entries. We've made sure that the performance remains excellent, even for larger documents.


Let your users update your documentation for you — By default, your Slate-generated documentation is hosted in a public GitHub repository. Not only does this mean you get free hosting for your docs with GitHub Pages, but it also makes it simple for other developers to make pull requests to your docs if they find typos or other problems. Of course, if you don't want to use GitHub, you're also welcome to host your docs elsewhere.


RTL Support Full right-to-left layout for RTL languages such as Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Hebrew etc.


Getting started with Slate is super easy! Simply fork this repository and follow the instructions below. Or, if you'd like to check out what Slate is capable of, take a look at the sample docs.
Getting Started with Slate
Prerequisites
You're going to need:

Linux or macOS — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer
Bundler — If Ruby is already installed, but the bundle command doesn't work, just run gem install bundler in a terminal.

Getting Set Up

Fork this repository on GitHub.
Clone your forked repository (not our original one) to your hard drive with git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/slate.git
cd slate
Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!
Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about editing Slate markdown, or how to publish your docs.
If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available in the wiki.
Note on JavaScript Runtime
For those who don't have JavaScript runtime or are experiencing JavaScript runtime issues with ExecJS, it is recommended to add the rubyracer gem to your gemfile and run bundle again.

Tesseract OCR







About
This package contains an OCR engine - libtesseract and a command line program - tesseract.
Tesseract 4 adds a new neural net (LSTM) based OCR engine which is focused
on line recognition, but also still supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of
Tesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns. Compatibility with
Tesseract 3 is enabled by using the Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0).
It also needs traineddata files which support the legacy engine, for example
those from the tessdata repository.
The lead developer is Ray Smith. The maintainer is Zdenko Podobny.
For a list of contributors see AUTHORS
and GitHub's log of contributors.
Tesseract has unicode (UTF-8) support, and can recognize more than 100 languages ""out of the box"".
Tesseract supports various output formats: plain text, hOCR (HTML), PDF, invisible-text-only PDF, TSV. The master branch also has experimental support for ALTO (XML) output.
You should note that in many cases, in order to get better OCR results, you'll need to improve the quality of the image you are giving Tesseract.
This project does not include a GUI application. If you need one, please see the 3rdParty wiki page.
Tesseract can be trained to recognize other languages. See Tesseract Training for more information.
Brief history
Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol and
at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some
more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998.
In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. Since 2006 it is developed by Google.
The latest (LSTM based) stable version is 4.0.0, released on October 29, 2018. Latest source code for 4.0 is available from master branch on GitHub. Open issues can be found in issue tracker, and Planning wiki.
The latest 3.5 version is 3.05.02, released on June 19, 2018. Latest source code for 3.05 is available from 3.05 branch on GitHub. There is no development for this version, but it can be used for special cases (e.g. see Regression of features from 3.0x).
See Release Notes and Change Log for more details of the releases.

PDF.js 
PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.
PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla Labs. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.
Contributing
PDF.js is an open source project and always looking for more contributors. To
get involved, visit:

Feel free to stop by #pdfjs on irc.mozilla.org for questions or guidance.
Getting Started
Online demo

https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

Browser Extensions
Firefox
PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.
Chrome

The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the Chrome Web Store.
This extension is maintained by @Rob--W.
Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue gulp chromium. Then open
Chrome, go to Tools > Extension and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory build/chromium.

Getting the Code
To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:
$ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
$ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the official package or via
nvm. You need to install the gulp package
globally (see also gulp's getting started):
$ npm install -g gulp-cli

If everything worked out, install all dependencies for PDF.js:
$ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a file:// URL. Run:
$ gulp server

and then you can open:

http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this requires an ES6 compatible browser; refer to Building PDF.js for usage with older browsers.
It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

Building PDF.js
In order to bundle all src/ files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:
$ gulp generic

This will generate pdf.js and pdf.worker.js in the build/generic/build/ directory.
Both scripts are needed but only pdf.js needs to be included since pdf.worker.js will
be loaded by pdf.js. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.
Using PDF.js in a web application
To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM and Bower under
the pdfjs-dist name. For more information and examples please refer to the
wiki page on this subject.
Including via a CDN
PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:

https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

Learning
You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

Interactive examples

More examples can be found in the examples folder. Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via gulp dist-install command.

1. Project Structure Practices
 1.1 Structure your solution by components
TL;DR: The worst large applications pitfall is maintaining a huge code base with hundreds of dependencies - such a monolith slows down developers as they try to incorporate new features. Instead, partition your code into components, each gets its own folder or a dedicated codebase, and ensure that each unit is kept small and simple. Visit 'Read More' below to see examples of correct project structure
Otherwise: When developers who code new features struggle to realize the impact of their change and fear to break other dependent components - deployments become slower and riskier. It's also considered harder to scale-out when all the business units are not separated
🔗 Read More: structure by components

 1.2 Layer your components, keep Express within its boundaries
TL;DR: Each component should contain 'layers' - a dedicated object for the web, logic, and data access code. This not only draws a clean separation of concerns but also significantly eases mocking and testing the system. Though this is a very common pattern, API developers tend to mix layers by passing the web layer objects (Express req, res) to business logic and data layers - this makes your application dependent on and accessible by Express only
Otherwise: App that mixes web objects with other layers cannot be accessed by testing code, CRON jobs, and other non-Express callers
🔗 Read More: layer your app

 1.3 Wrap common utilities as npm packages
TL;DR: In a large app that constitutes a large code base, cross-cutting-concern utilities like logger, encryption and alike, should be wrapped by your own code and exposed as private npm packages. This allows sharing them among multiple code bases and projects
Otherwise: You'll have to invent your own deployment and dependency wheel
🔗 Read More: Structure by feature

 1.4 Separate Express 'app' and 'server'
TL;DR: Avoid the nasty habit of defining the entire Express app in a single huge file - separate your 'Express' definition to at least two files: the API declaration (app.js) and the networking concerns (WWW). For even better structure, locate your API declaration within components
Otherwise: Your API will be accessible for testing via HTTP calls only (slower and much harder to generate coverage reports). It probably won't be a big pleasure to maintain hundreds of lines of code in a single file
🔗 Read More: separate Express 'app' and 'server'

 1.5 Use environment aware, secure and hierarchical config
TL;DR: A perfect and flawless configuration setup should ensure (a) keys can be read from file AND from environment variable (b) secrets are kept outside committed code (c) config is hierarchical for easier findability. There are a few packages that can help tick most of those boxes like rc, nconf and config
Otherwise: Failing to satisfy any of the config requirements will simply bog down the development or devops team. Probably both
🔗 Read More: configuration best practices

2. Error Handling Practices
 2.1 Use Async-Await or promises for async error handling
TL;DR: Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell (a.k.a the pyramid of doom). The best gift you can give to your code is using a reputable promise library or async-await instead which enables a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch
Otherwise: Node.js callback style, function(err, response), is a promising way to un-maintainable code due to the mix of error handling with casual code, excessive nesting, and awkward coding patterns
🔗 Read More: avoiding callbacks

 2.2 Use only the built-in Error object
TL;DR: Many throw errors as a string or as some custom type – this complicates the error handling logic and the interoperability between modules. Whether you reject a promise, throw an exception or emit an error – using only the built-in Error object will increase uniformity and prevent loss of information
Otherwise: When invoking some component, being uncertain which type of errors come in return – it makes proper error handling much harder. Even worse, using custom types to describe errors might lead to loss of critical error information like the stack trace!
🔗 Read More: using the built-in error object

 2.3 Distinguish operational vs programmer errors
TL;DR: Operational errors (e.g. API received an invalid input) refer to known cases where the error impact is fully understood and can be handled thoughtfully. On the other hand, programmer error (e.g. trying to read undefined variable) refers to unknown code failures that dictate to gracefully restart the application
Otherwise: You may always restart the application when an error appears, but why let ~5000 online users down because of a minor, predicted, operational error? the opposite is also not ideal – keeping the application up when an unknown issue (programmer error) occurred might lead to an unpredicted behavior. Differentiating the two allows acting tactfully and applying a balanced approach based on the given context
🔗 Read More: operational vs programmer error

 2.4 Handle errors centrally, not within an Express middleware
TL;DR: Error handling logic such as mail to admin and logging should be encapsulated in a dedicated and centralized object that all endpoints (e.g. Express middleware, cron jobs, unit-testing) call when an error comes in
Otherwise: Not handling errors within a single place will lead to code duplication and probably to improperly handled errors
🔗 Read More: handling errors in a centralized place

 2.5 Document API errors using Swagger or GraphQL
TL;DR: Let your API callers know which errors might come in return so they can handle these thoughtfully without crashing. For RESTful APIs, this is usually done with documentation frameworks like Swagger. If you're using GraphQL, you can utilize your schema and comments as well.
Otherwise: An API client might decide to crash and restart only because it received back an error it couldn’t understand. Note: the caller of your API might be you (very typical in a microservice environment)
🔗 Read More: documenting API errors in Swagger or GraphQL

 2.6 Exit the process gracefully when a stranger comes to town
TL;DR: When an unknown error occurs (a developer error, see best practice 2.3) - there is uncertainty about the application healthiness. A common practice suggests restarting the process carefully using a process management tool like Forever or PM2
Otherwise: When an unfamiliar exception occurs, some object might be in a faulty state (e.g. an event emitter which is used globally and not firing events anymore due to some internal failure) and all future requests might fail or behave crazily
🔗 Read More: shutting the process

 2.7 Use a mature logger to increase error visibility
TL;DR: A set of mature logging tools like Winston, Bunyan or Log4js, will speed-up error discovery and understanding. So forget about console.log
Otherwise: Skimming through console.logs or manually through messy text file without querying tools or a decent log viewer might keep you busy at work until late
🔗 Read More: using a mature logger

 2.8 Test error flows using your favorite test framework
TL;DR: Whether professional automated QA or plain manual developer testing – Ensure that your code not only satisfies positive scenarios but also handles and returns the right errors. Testing frameworks like Mocha & Chai can handle this easily (see code examples within the ""Gist popup"")
Otherwise: Without testing, whether automatically or manually, you can’t rely on your code to return the right errors. Without meaningful errors – there’s no error handling
🔗 Read More: testing error flows

 2.9 Discover errors and downtime using APM products
TL;DR: Monitoring and performance products (a.k.a APM) proactively gauge your codebase or API so they can automagically highlight errors, crashes and slow parts that you were missing
Otherwise: You might spend great effort on measuring API performance and downtimes, probably you’ll never be aware which are your slowest code parts under real-world scenario and how these affect the UX
🔗 Read More: using APM products

 2.10 Catch unhandled promise rejections
TL;DR: Any exception thrown within a promise will get swallowed and discarded unless a developer didn’t forget to explicitly handle. Even if your code is subscribed to process.uncaughtException! Overcome this by registering to the event process.unhandledRejection
Otherwise: Your errors will get swallowed and leave no trace. Nothing to worry about
🔗 Read More: catching unhandled promise rejection

 2.11 Fail fast, validate arguments using a dedicated library
TL;DR: This should be part of your Express best practices – Assert API input to avoid nasty bugs that are much harder to track later. The validation code is usually tedious unless you are using a very cool helper library like Joi
Otherwise: Consider this – your function expects a numeric argument “Discount” which the caller forgets to pass, later on, your code checks if Discount!=0 (amount of allowed discount is greater than zero), then it will allow the user to enjoy a discount. OMG, what a nasty bug. Can you see it?
🔗 Read More: failing fast

⬆ Return to top
3. Code Style Practices
 3.1 Use ESLint
TL;DR: ESLint is the de-facto standard for checking possible code errors and fixing code style, not only to identify nitty-gritty spacing issues but also to detect serious code anti-patterns like developers throwing errors without classification. Though ESLint can automatically fix code styles, other tools like prettier and beautify are more powerful in formatting the fix and work in conjunction with ESLint
Otherwise: Developers will focus on tedious spacing and line-width concerns and time might be wasted overthinking the project's code style
🔗 Read More: Using ESLint and Prettier

 3.2 Node.js specific plugins
TL;DR: On top of ESLint standard rules that cover vanilla JavaScript, add Node.js specific plugins like eslint-plugin-node, eslint-plugin-mocha and eslint-plugin-node-security
Otherwise: Many faulty Node.js code patterns might escape under the radar. For example, developers might require(variableAsPath) files with a variable given as path which allows attackers to execute any JS script. Node.js linters can detect such patterns and complain early

 3.3 Start a Codeblock's Curly Braces on the Same Line
TL;DR: The opening curly braces of a code block should be on the same line as the opening statement
Code Example
// Do
function someFunction() {
  // code block
}

// Avoid
function someFunction()
{
  // code block
}
Otherwise: Deferring from this best practice might lead to unexpected results, as seen in the StackOverflow thread below:
🔗 Read more: ""Why do results vary based on curly brace placement?"" (StackOverflow)

 3.4 Don't Forget the Semicolon
TL;DR: While not unanimously agreed upon, it is still recommended to put a semicolon at the end of each statement. This will make your code more readable and explicit to other developers who read it
Otherwise: As seen in the previous section, JavaScript's interpreter automatically adds a semicolon at the end of a statement if there isn't one, or considers a statement as not ended where it should, which might lead to some undesired results
Code example
// Do
const count = 2;
(function doSomething() {
  // do something amazing
}());

// Avoid — throws exception
const count = 2 // it tries to run 2(), but 2 is not a function
(function doSomething() {
  // do something amazing
}())

 3.5 Name your functions
TL;DR: Name all functions, including closures and callbacks. Avoid anonymous functions. This is especially useful when profiling a node app. Naming all functions will allow you to easily understand what you're looking at when checking a memory snapshot
Otherwise: Debugging production issues using a core dump (memory snapshot) might become challenging as you notice significant memory consumption from anonymous functions

 3.6 Use naming conventions for variables, constants, functions and classes
TL;DR: Use lowerCamelCase when naming constants, variables and functions and UpperCamelCase (capital first letter as well) when naming classes. This will help you to easily distinguish between plain variables/functions, and classes that require instantiation. Use descriptive names, but try to keep them short
Otherwise: Javascript is the only language in the world which allows invoking a constructor (""Class"") directly without instantiating it first. Consequently, Classes and function-constructors are differentiated by starting with UpperCamelCase
Code Example
// for class name we use UpperCamelCase
class SomeClassExample {}

// for const names we use the const keyword and lowerCamelCase
const config = {
  key: 'value'
};

// for variables and functions names we use lowerCamelCase
let someVariableExample = 'value';
function doSomething() {}

 3.7 Prefer const over let. Ditch the var
TL;DR: Using const means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. Preferring const will help you to not be tempted to use the same variable for different uses, and make your code clearer. If a variable needs to be reassigned, in a for loop, for example, use let to declare it. Another important aspect of let is that a variable declared using it is only available in the block scope in which it was defined. var is function scoped, not block scoped, and shouldn't be used in ES6 now that you have const and let at your disposal
Otherwise: Debugging becomes way more cumbersome when following a variable that frequently changes
🔗 Read more: JavaScript ES6+: var, let, or const? 

 3.8 Require modules first, not inside functions
TL;DR: Require modules at the beginning of each file, before and outside of any functions. This simple best practice will not only help you easily and quickly tell the dependencies of a file right at the top but also avoids a couple of potential problems
Otherwise: Requires are run synchronously by Node.js. If they are called from within a function, it may block other requests from being handled at a more critical time. Also, if a required module or any of its own dependencies throw an error and crash the server, it is best to find out about it as soon as possible, which might not be the case if that module is required from within a function

 3.9 Require modules by folders, opposed to the files directly
TL;DR: When developing a module/library in a folder, place an index.js file that exposes the module's internals so every consumer will pass through it. This serves as an 'interface' to your module and eases future changes without breaking the contract
Otherwise: Changing the internal structure of files or the signature may break the interface with clients
Code example
// Do
module.exports.SMSProvider = require('./SMSProvider');
module.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require('./SMSNumberResolver');

// Avoid
module.exports.SMSProvider = require('./SMSProvider/SMSProvider.js');
module.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require('./SMSNumberResolver/SMSNumberResolver.js');

 3.10 Use the === operator
TL;DR: Prefer the strict equality operator === over the weaker abstract equality operator ==. == will compare two variables after converting them to a common type. There is no type conversion in ===, and both variables must be of the same type to be equal
Otherwise: Unequal variables might return true when compared with the == operator
Code example
'' == '0'           // false
0 == ''             // true
0 == '0'            // true

false == 'false'    // false
false == '0'        // true

false == undefined  // false
false == null       // false
null == undefined   // true

' \t\r\n ' == 0     // true
All statements above will return false if used with ===

 3.11 Use Async Await, avoid callbacks
TL;DR: Node 8 LTS now has full support for Async-await. This is a new way of dealing with asynchronous code which supersedes callbacks and promises. Async-await is non-blocking, and it makes asynchronous code look synchronous. The best gift you can give to your code is using async-await which provides a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch
Otherwise: Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell - this style forces to check errors all over, deal with awkward code nesting and makes it difficult to reason about the code flow
🔗Read more: Guide to async await 1.0

 3.12 Use arrow function expressions (=>)
TL;DR: Though it's recommended to use async-await and avoid function parameters when dealing with older APIs that accept promises or callbacks - arrow functions make the code structure more compact and keep the lexical context of the root function (i.e. this)
Otherwise: Longer code (in ES5 functions) is more prone to bugs and cumbersome to read
🔗 Read more: It’s Time to Embrace Arrow Functions

⬆ Return to top
4. Testing And Overall Quality Practices
 4.1 At the very least, write API (component) testing
TL;DR: Most projects just don't have any automated testing due to short timetables or often the 'testing project' ran out of control and was abandoned. For that reason, prioritize and start with API testing which is the easiest way to write and provides more coverage than unit testing (you may even craft API tests without code using tools like Postman. Afterward, should you have more resources and time, continue with advanced test types like unit testing, DB testing, performance testing, etc
Otherwise: You may spend long days on writing unit tests to find out that you got only 20% system coverage

 4.2 Include 3 parts in each test name
TL;DR: Make the test speak at the requirements level so it's self explanatory also to QA engineers and developers who are not familiar with the code internals. State in the test name what is being tested (unit under test), under what circumstances and what is the expected result
Otherwise: A deployment just failed, a test named “Add product” failed. Does this tell you what exactly is malfunctioning?
🔗 Read More: Include 3 parts in each test name

 4.3 Detect code issues with a linter
TL;DR: Use a code linter to check basic quality and detect anti-patterns early. Run it before any test and add it as a pre-commit git-hook to minimize the time needed to review and correct any issue. Also check Section 3 on Code Style Practices
Otherwise: You may let pass some anti-pattern and possible vulnerable code to your production environment.

 4.4 Avoid global test fixtures and seeds, add data per-test
TL;DR: To prevent tests coupling and easily reason about the test flow, each test should add and act on its own set of DB rows. Whenever a test needs to pull or assume the existence of some DB data - it must explicitly add that data and avoid mutating any other records
Otherwise: Consider a scenario where deployment is aborted due to failing tests, team is now going to spend precious investigation time that ends in a sad conclusion: the system works well, the tests however interfere with each other and break the build
🔗 Read More: Avoid global test fixtures

 4.5 Constantly inspect for vulnerable dependencies
TL;DR: Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities. This can get easily tamed using community and commercial tools such as 🔗 npm audit and 🔗 snyk.io that can be invoked from your CI on every build
Otherwise: Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious

 4.6 Tag your tests
TL;DR: Different tests must run on different scenarios: quick smoke, IO-less, tests should run when a developer saves or commits a file, full end-to-end tests usually run when a new pull request is submitted, etc. This can be achieved by tagging tests with keywords like #cold #api #sanity so you can grep with your testing harness and invoke the desired subset. For example, this is how you would invoke only the sanity test group with Mocha: mocha --grep 'sanity'
Otherwise: Running all the tests, including tests that perform dozens of DB queries, any time a developer makes a small change can be extremely slow and keeps developers away from running tests

 4.7 Check your test coverage, it helps to identify wrong test patterns
TL;DR: Code coverage tools like Istanbul/NYC are great for 3 reasons: it comes for free (no effort is required to benefit this reports), it helps to identify a decrease in testing coverage, and last but not least it highlights testing mismatches: by looking at colored code coverage reports you may notice, for example, code areas that are never tested like catch clauses (meaning that tests only invoke the happy paths and not how the app behaves on errors). Set it to fail builds if the coverage falls under a certain threshold
Otherwise: There won't be any automated metric telling you when a large portion of your code is not covered by testing

 4.8 Inspect for outdated packages
TL;DR: Use your preferred tool (e.g. 'npm outdated' or npm-check-updates to detect installed packages which are outdated, inject this check into your CI pipeline and even make a build fail in a severe scenario. For example, a severe scenario might be when an installed package is 5 patch commits behind (e.g. local version is 1.3.1 and repository version is 1.3.8) or it is tagged as deprecated by its author - kill the build and prevent deploying this version
Otherwise: Your production will run packages that have been explicitly tagged by their author as risky

 4.9 Use docker-compose for e2e testing
TL;DR: End to end (e2e) testing which includes live data used to be the weakest link of the CI process as it depends on multiple heavy services like DB. Docker-compose turns this problem into a breeze by crafting production-like environment using a simple text file and easy commands. It allows crafting all the dependent services, DB and isolated network for e2e testing. Last but not least, it can keep a stateless environment that is invoked before each test suite and dies right after
Otherwise: Without docker-compose teams must maintain a testing DB for each testing environment including developers' machines, keep all those DBs in sync so test results won't vary across environments

 4.10 Refactor regularly using static analysis tools
TL;DR: Using static analysis tools helps by giving objective ways to improve code quality and keeps your code maintainable. You can add static analysis tools to your CI build to fail when it finds code smells. Its main selling points over plain linting are the ability to inspect quality in the context of multiple files (e.g. detect duplications), perform advanced analysis (e.g. code complexity) and follow the history and progress of code issues. Two examples of tools you can use are Sonarqube (2,600+ stars) and Code Climate (1,500+ stars).
Otherwise: With poor code quality, bugs and performance will always be an issue that no shiny new library or state of the art features can fix
🔗 Read More: Refactoring!

 4.11 Carefully choose your CI platform (Jenkins vs CircleCI vs Travis vs Rest of the world)
TL;DR: Your continuous integration platform (CICD) will host all the quality tools (e.g test, lint) so it should come with a vibrant ecosystem of plugins. Jenkins used to be the default for many projects as it has the biggest community along with a very powerful platform at the price of complex setup that demands a steep learning curve. Nowadays, it has become much easier to set up a CI solution using SaaS tools like CircleCI and others. These tools allow crafting a flexible CI pipeline without the burden of managing the whole infrastructure. Eventually, it's a trade-off between robustness and speed - choose your side carefully
Otherwise: Choosing some niche vendor might get you blocked once you need some advanced customization. On the other hand, going with Jenkins might burn precious time on infrastructure setup

5. Going To Production Practices
 5.1. Monitoring!
TL;DR: Monitoring is a game of finding out issues before customers do – obviously this should be assigned unprecedented importance. The market is overwhelmed with offers thus consider starting with defining the basic metrics you must follow (my suggestions inside), then go over additional fancy features and choose the solution that ticks all boxes. Click ‘The Gist’ below for an overview of the solutions
Otherwise: Failure === disappointed customers. Simple
🔗 Read More: Monitoring!

 5.2. Increase transparency using smart logging
TL;DR: Logs can be a dumb warehouse of debug statements or the enabler of a beautiful dashboard that tells the story of your app. Plan your logging platform from day 1: how logs are collected, stored and analyzed to ensure that the desired information (e.g. error rate, following an entire transaction through services and servers, etc) can really be extracted
Otherwise: You end up with a black box that is hard to reason about, then you start re-writing all logging statements to add additional information
🔗 Read More: Increase transparency using smart logging

 5.3. Delegate anything possible (e.g. gzip, SSL) to a reverse proxy
TL;DR: Node is awfully bad at doing CPU intensive tasks like gzipping, SSL termination, etc. You should use ‘real’ middleware services like nginx, HAproxy or cloud vendor services instead
Otherwise: Your poor single thread will stay busy doing infrastructural tasks instead of dealing with your application core and performance will degrade accordingly
🔗 Read More: Delegate anything possible (e.g. gzip, SSL) to a reverse proxy

 5.4. Lock dependencies
TL;DR: Your code must be identical across all environments, but amazingly npm lets dependencies drift across environments by default – when you install packages at various environments it tries to fetch packages’ latest patch version. Overcome this by using npm config files, .npmrc, that tell each environment to save the exact (not the latest) version of each package. Alternatively, for finer grained control use npm shrinkwrap. *Update: as of NPM5, dependencies are locked by default. The new package manager in town, Yarn, also got us covered by default
Otherwise: QA will thoroughly test the code and approve a version that will behave differently in production. Even worse, different servers in the same production cluster might run different code
🔗 Read More: Lock dependencies

 5.5. Guard process uptime using the right tool
TL;DR: The process must go on and get restarted upon failures. For simple scenarios, process management tools like PM2 might be enough but in today's ‘dockerized’ world, cluster management tools should be considered as well
Otherwise: Running dozens of instances without a clear strategy and too many tools together (cluster management, docker, PM2) might lead to DevOps chaos
🔗 Read More: Guard process uptime using the right tool

 5.6. Utilize all CPU cores
TL;DR: At its basic form, a Node app runs on a single CPU core while all others are left idling. It’s your duty to replicate the Node process and utilize all CPUs – For small-medium apps you may use Node Cluster or PM2. For a larger app consider replicating the process using some Docker cluster (e.g. K8S, ECS) or deployment scripts that are based on Linux init system (e.g. systemd)
Otherwise: Your app will likely utilize only 25% of its available resources(!) or even less. Note that a typical server has 4 CPU cores or more, naive deployment of Node.js utilizes only 1 (even using PaaS services like AWS beanstalk!)
🔗 Read More: Utilize all CPU cores

 5.7. Create a ‘maintenance endpoint’
TL;DR: Expose a set of system-related information, like memory usage and REPL, etc in a secured API. Although it’s highly recommended to rely on standard and battle-tests tools, some valuable information and operations are easier done using code
Otherwise: You’ll find that you’re performing many “diagnostic deploys” – shipping code to production only to extract some information for diagnostic purposes
🔗 Read More: Create a ‘maintenance endpoint’

 5.8. Discover errors and downtime using APM products
TL;DR: Application monitoring and performance products (a.k.a APM) proactively gauge codebase and API so they can auto-magically go beyond traditional monitoring and measure the overall user-experience across services and tiers. For example, some APM products can highlight a transaction that loads too slow on the end-users side while suggesting the root cause
Otherwise: You might spend great effort on measuring API performance and downtimes, probably you’ll never be aware which is your slowest code parts under real-world scenario and how these affect the UX
🔗 Read More: Discover errors and downtime using APM products

 5.9. Make your code production-ready
TL;DR: Code with the end in mind, plan for production from day 1. This sounds a bit vague so I’ve compiled a few development tips that are closely related to production maintenance (click Gist below)
Otherwise: A world champion IT/DevOps guy won’t save a system that is badly written
🔗 Read More: Make your code production-ready

 5.10. Measure and guard the memory usage
TL;DR: Node.js has controversial relationships with memory: the v8 engine has soft limits on memory usage (1.4GB) and there are known paths to leak memory in Node’s code – thus watching Node’s process memory is a must. In small apps, you may gauge memory periodically using shell commands but in medium-large apps consider baking your memory watch into a robust monitoring system
Otherwise: Your process memory might leak a hundred megabytes a day like how it happened at Walmart
🔗 Read More: Measure and guard the memory usage

 5.11. Get your frontend assets out of Node
TL;DR: Serve frontend content using dedicated middleware (nginx, S3, CDN) because Node performance really gets hurt when dealing with many static files due to its single-threaded model
Otherwise: Your single Node thread will be busy streaming hundreds of html/images/angular/react files instead of allocating all its resources for the task it was born for – serving dynamic content
🔗 Read More: Get your frontend assets out of Node

 5.12. Be stateless, kill your servers almost every day
TL;DR: Store any type of data (e.g. user sessions, cache, uploaded files) within external data stores. Consider ‘killing’ your servers periodically or use ‘serverless’ platform (e.g. AWS Lambda) that explicitly enforces a stateless behavior
Otherwise: Failure at a given server will result in application downtime instead of just killing a faulty machine. Moreover, scaling-out elasticity will get more challenging due to the reliance on a specific server
🔗 Read More: Be stateless, kill your Servers almost every day

 5.13. Use tools that automatically detect vulnerabilities
TL;DR: Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities (from time to time) that can put a system at risk. This can be easily tamed using community and commercial tools that constantly check for vulnerabilities and warn (locally or at GitHub), some can even patch them immediately
Otherwise: Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require you to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious
🔗 Read More: Use tools that automatically detect vulnerabilities

 5.14. Assign a transaction id to each log statement
TL;DR: Assign the same identifier, transaction-id: {some value}, to each log entry within a single request. Then when inspecting errors in logs, easily conclude what happened before and after. Unfortunately, this is not easy to achieve in Node due to its async nature, see code examples inside
Otherwise: Looking at a production error log without the context – what happened before – makes it much harder and slower to reason about the issue
🔗 Read More: Assign ‘TransactionId’ to each log statement

 5.15. Set NODE_ENV=production
TL;DR: Set the environment variable NODE_ENV to ‘production’ or ‘development’ to flag whether production optimizations should get activated – many npm packages determine the current environment and optimize their code for production
Otherwise: Omitting this simple property might greatly degrade performance. For example, when using Express for server-side rendering omitting NODE_ENV makes it slower by a factor of three!
🔗 Read More: Set NODE_ENV=production

 5.16. Design automated, atomic and zero-downtime deployments
TL;DR: Research shows that teams who perform many deployments lower the probability of severe production issues. Fast and automated deployments that don’t require risky manual steps and service downtime significantly improve the deployment process. You should probably achieve this using Docker combined with CI tools as they became the industry standard for streamlined deployment
Otherwise: Long deployments -> production downtime & human-related error -> team unconfident in making deployment -> fewer deployments and features

 5.17. Use an LTS release of Node.js
TL;DR: Ensure you are using an LTS version of Node.js to receive critical bug fixes, security updates and performance improvements
Otherwise: Newly discovered bugs or vulnerabilities could be used to exploit an application running in production, and your application may become unsupported by various modules and harder to maintain
🔗 Read More: Use an LTS release of Node.js

 5.18. Don't route logs within the app
TL;DR: Log destinations should not be hard-coded by developers within the application code, but instead should be defined by the execution environment the application runs in. Developers should write logs to stdout using a logger utility and then let the execution environment (container, server, etc.) pipe the stdout stream to the appropriate destination (i.e. Splunk, Graylog, ElasticSearch, etc.).
Otherwise: Application handling log routing === hard to scale, loss of logs, poor separation of concerns
🔗 Read More: Log Routing

6. Security Best Practices



 6.1. Embrace linter security rules
 
TL;DR: Make use of security-related linter plugins such as eslint-plugin-security to catch security vulnerabilities and issues as early as possible, preferably while they're being coded. This can help catching security weaknesses like using eval, invoking a child process or importing a module with a string literal (e.g. user input). Click 'Read more' below to see code examples that will get caught by a security linter
Otherwise: What could have been a straightforward security weakness during development becomes a major issue in production. Also, the project may not follow consistent code security practices, leading to vulnerabilities being introduced, or sensitive secrets committed into remote repositories
🔗 Read More: Lint rules

 6.2. Limit concurrent requests using a middleware

TL;DR: DOS attacks are very popular and relatively easy to conduct. Implement rate limiting using an external service such as cloud load balancers, cloud firewalls, nginx, rate-limiter-flexible package, or (for smaller and less critical apps) a rate-limiting middleware (e.g. express-rate-limit)
Otherwise: An application could be subject to an attack resulting in a denial of service where real users receive a degraded or unavailable service.
🔗 Read More: Implement rate limiting

 6.3 Extract secrets from config files or use packages to encrypt them
 
TL;DR: Never store plain-text secrets in configuration files or source code. Instead, make use of secret-management systems like Vault products, Kubernetes/Docker Secrets, or using environment variables. As a last resort, secrets stored in source control must be encrypted and managed (rolling keys, expiring, auditing, etc). Make use of pre-commit/push hooks to prevent committing secrets accidentally
Otherwise: Source control, even for private repositories, can mistakenly be made public, at which point all secrets are exposed. Access to source control for an external party will inadvertently provide access to related systems (databases, apis, services, etc).
🔗 Read More: Secret management

 6.4. Prevent query injection vulnerabilities with ORM/ODM libraries

TL;DR: To prevent SQL/NoSQL injection and other malicious attacks, always make use of an ORM/ODM or a database library that escapes data or supports named or indexed parameterized queries, and takes care of validating user input for expected types. Never just use JavaScript template strings or string concatenation to inject values into queries as this opens your application to a wide spectrum of vulnerabilities. All the reputable Node.js data access libraries (e.g. Sequelize, Knex, mongoose) have built-in protection against injection attacks.
Otherwise: Unvalidated or unsanitized user input could lead to operator injection when working with MongoDB for NoSQL, and not using a proper sanitization system or ORM will easily allow SQL injection attacks, creating a giant vulnerability.
🔗 Read More: Query injection prevention using ORM/ODM libraries

 6.5. Collection of generic security best practices
TL;DR: This is a collection of security advice that is not related directly to Node.js - the Node implementation is not much different than any other language. Click read more to skim through.
🔗 Read More: Common security best practices

 6.6. Adjust the HTTP response headers for enhanced security

TL;DR: Your application should be using secure headers to prevent attackers from using common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other malicious attacks. These can be configured easily using modules like helmet.
Otherwise: Attackers could perform direct attacks on your application's users, leading to huge security vulnerabilities
🔗 Read More: Using secure headers in your application

 6.7. Constantly and automatically inspect for vulnerable dependencies

TL;DR: With the npm ecosystem it is common to have many dependencies for a project. Dependencies should always be kept in check as new vulnerabilities are found. Use tools like npm audit or snyk to track, monitor and patch vulnerable dependencies. Integrate these tools with your CI setup so you catch a vulnerable dependency before it makes it to production.
Otherwise: An attacker could detect your web framework and attack all its known vulnerabilities.
🔗 Read More: Dependency security

 6.8. Avoid using the Node.js crypto library for handling passwords, use Bcrypt

TL;DR: Passwords or secrets (API keys) should be stored using a secure hash + salt function like bcrypt, that should be a preferred choice over its JavaScript implementation due to performance and security reasons.
Otherwise: Passwords or secrets that are persisted without using a secure function are vulnerable to brute forcing and dictionary attacks that will lead to their disclosure eventually.
🔗 Read More: Use Bcrypt

 6.9. Escape HTML, JS and CSS output

TL;DR: Untrusted data that is sent down to the browser might get executed instead of just being displayed, this is commonly referred as a cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack. Mitigate this by using dedicated libraries that explicitly mark the data as pure content that should never get executed (i.e. encoding, escaping)
Otherwise: An attacker might store malicious JavaScript code in your DB which will then be sent as-is to the poor clients
🔗 Read More: Escape output

 6.10. Validate incoming JSON schemas
 
TL;DR: Validate the incoming requests' body payload and ensure it meets expectations, fail fast if it doesn't. To avoid tedious validation coding within each route you may use lightweight JSON-based validation schemas such as jsonschema or joi
Otherwise: Your generosity and permissive approach greatly increases the attack surface and encourages the attacker to try out many inputs until they find some combination to crash the application
🔗 Read More: Validate incoming JSON schemas

 6.11. Support blacklisting JWTs

TL;DR: When using JSON Web Tokens (for example, with Passport.js), by default there's no mechanism to revoke access from issued tokens. Once you discover some malicious user activity, there's no way to stop them from accessing the system as long as they hold a valid token. Mitigate this by implementing a blacklist of untrusted tokens that are validated on each request.
Otherwise: Expired, or misplaced tokens could be used maliciously by a third party to access an application and impersonate the owner of the token.
🔗 Read More: Blacklist JSON Web Tokens

 6.12. Prevent brute-force attacks against authorization

TL;DR: A simple and powerful technique is to limit authorization attempts using two metrics:

The first is number of consecutive failed attempts by the same user unique ID/name and IP address.
The second is number of failed attempts from an IP address over some long period of time. For example, block an IP address if it makes 100 failed attempts in one day.

Otherwise: An attacker can issue unlimited automated password attempts to gain access to privileged accounts on an application
🔗 Read More: Login rate limiting

 6.13. Run Node.js as non-root user

TL;DR: There is a common scenario where Node.js runs as a root user with unlimited permissions. For example, this is the default behaviour in Docker containers. It's recommended to create a non-root user and either bake it into the Docker image (examples given below) or run the process on this user's behalf by invoking the container with the flag ""-u username""
Otherwise: An attacker who manages to run a script on the server gets unlimited power over the local machine (e.g. change iptable and re-route traffic to his server)
🔗 Read More: Run Node.js as non-root user

 6.14. Limit payload size using a reverse-proxy or a middleware
 
TL;DR: The bigger the body payload is, the harder your single thread works in processing it. This is an opportunity for attackers to bring servers to their knees without tremendous amount of requests (DOS/DDOS attacks). Mitigate this limiting the body size of incoming requests on the edge (e.g. firewall, ELB) or by configuring express body parser to accept only small-size payloads
Otherwise: Your application will have to deal with large requests, unable to process the other important work it has to accomplish, leading to performance implications and vulnerability towards DOS attacks
🔗 Read More: Limit payload size

 6.15. Avoid JavaScript eval statements
  
TL;DR: eval is evil as it allows executing custom JavaScript code during run time. This is not just a performance concern but also an important security concern due to malicious JavaScript code that may be sourced from user input. Another language feature that should be avoided is new Function constructor. setTimeout and setInterval should never be passed dynamic JavaScript code either.
Otherwise: Malicious JavaScript code finds a way into text passed into eval or other real-time evaluating JavaScript language functions, and will gain complete access to JavaScript permissions on the page. This vulnerability is often manifested as an XSS attack.
🔗 Read More: Avoid JavaScript eval statements

 6.16. Prevent evil RegEx from overloading your single thread execution

TL;DR: Regular Expressions, while being handy, pose a real threat to JavaScript applications at large, and the Node.js platform in particular. A user input for text to match might require an outstanding amount of CPU cycles to process. RegEx processing might be inefficient to an extent that a single request that validates 10 words can block the entire event loop for 6 seconds and set the CPU on 🔥. For that reason, prefer third-party validation packages like validator.js instead of writing your own Regex patterns, or make use of safe-regex to detect vulnerable regex patterns
Otherwise: Poorly written regexes could be susceptible to Regular Expression DoS attacks that will block the event loop completely. For example, the popular moment package was found vulnerable with malicious RegEx usage in November of 2017
🔗 Read More: Prevent malicious RegEx

 6.17. Avoid module loading using a variable
  
TL;DR: Avoid requiring/importing another file with a path that was given as parameter due to the concern that it could have originated from user input. This rule can be extended for accessing files in general (i.e. fs.readFile()) or other sensitive resource access with dynamic variables originating from user input. Eslint-plugin-security linter can catch such patterns and warn early enough
Otherwise: Malicious user input could find its way to a parameter that is used to require tampered files, for example, a previously uploaded file on the filesystem, or access already existing system files.
🔗 Read More: Safe module loading

 6.18. Run unsafe code in a sandbox
  
TL;DR: When tasked to run external code that is given at run-time (e.g. plugin), use any sort of 'sandbox' execution environment that isolates and guards the main code against the plugin. This can be achieved using a dedicated process (e.g. cluster.fork()), serverless environment or dedicated npm packages that act as a sandbox
Otherwise: A plugin can attack through an endless variety of options like infinite loops, memory overloading, and access to sensitive process environment variables
🔗 Read More: Run unsafe code in a sandbox

 6.19. Take extra care when working with child processes
  
TL;DR: Avoid using child processes when possible and validate and sanitize input to mitigate shell injection attacks if you still have to. Prefer using child_process.execFile which by definition will only execute a single command with a set of attributes and will not allow shell parameter expansion.
Otherwise: Naive use of child processes could result in remote command execution or shell injection attacks due to malicious user input passed to an unsanitized system command.
🔗 Read More: Be cautious when working with child processes

 6.20. Hide error details from clients

TL;DR: An integrated express error handler hides the error details by default. However, great are the chances that you implement your own error handling logic with custom Error objects (considered by many as a best practice). If you do so, ensure not to return the entire Error object to the client, which might contain some sensitive application details
Otherwise: Sensitive application details such as server file paths, third party modules in use, and other internal workflows of the application which could be exploited by an attacker, could be leaked from information found in a stack trace
🔗 Read More: Hide error details from client

 6.21. Configure 2FA for npm or Yarn

TL;DR: Any step in the development chain should be protected with MFA (multi-factor authentication), npm/Yarn are a sweet opportunity for attackers who can get their hands on some developer's password. Using developer credentials, attackers can inject malicious code into libraries that are widely installed across projects and services. Maybe even across the web if published in public. Enabling 2-factor-authentication in npm leaves almost zero chances for attackers to alter your package code.
Otherwise: Have you heard about the eslint developer who's password was hijacked?

 6.22. Modify session middleware settings

TL;DR: Each web framework and technology has its known weaknesses - telling an attacker which web framework we use is a great help for them. Using the default settings for session middlewares can expose your app to module- and framework-specific hijacking attacks in a similar way to the X-Powered-By header. Try hiding anything that identifies and reveals your tech stack (E.g. Node.js, express)
Otherwise: Cookies could be sent over insecure connections, and an attacker might use session identification to identify the underlying framework of the web application, as well as module-specific vulnerabilities
🔗 Read More: Cookie and session security

 6.23. Avoid DOS attacks by explicitly setting when a process should crash

TL;DR: The Node process will crash when errors are not handled. Many best practices even recommend to exit even though an error was caught and got handled. Express, for example, will crash on any asynchronous error - unless you wrap routes with a catch clause. This opens a very sweet attack spot for attackers who recognize what input makes the process crash and repeatedly send the same request. There's no instant remedy for this but a few techniques can mitigate the pain: Alert with critical severity anytime a process crashes due to an unhandled error, validate the input and avoid crashing the process due to invalid user input, wrap all routes with a catch and consider not to crash when an error originated within a request (as opposed to what happens globally)
Otherwise: This is just an educated guess: given many Node.js applications, if we try passing an empty JSON body to all POST requests - a handful of applications will crash. At that point, we can just repeat sending the same request to take down the applications with ease

 6.24. Prevent unsafe redirects

TL;DR: Redirects that do not validate user input can enable attackers to launch phishing scams, steal user credentials, and perform other malicious actions.
Otherwise: If an attacker discovers that you are not validating external, user-supplied input, they may exploit this vulnerability by posting specially-crafted links on forums, social media, and other public places to get users to click it.
🔗 Read More: Prevent unsafe redirects

 6.25. Avoid publishing secrets to the npm registry

TL;DR: Precautions should be taken to avoid the risk of accidentally publishing secrets to public npm registries. An .npmignore file can be used to blacklist specific files or folders, or the files array in package.json can act as a whitelist.
Otherwise: Your project's API keys, passwords or other secrets are open to be abused by anyone who comes across them, which may result in financial loss, impersonation, and other risks.
🔗 Read More: Avoid publishing secrets

7. Performance Best Practices
Our contributors are working on this section. Would you like to join?
 7.1. Prefer native JS methods over user-land utils like Lodash
TL;DR: It's often more penalising to use utility libraries like lodash and underscore over native methods as it leads to unneeded dependencies and slower performance.
Bear in mind that with the introduction of the new V8 engine alongside the new ES standards, native methods were improved in such a way that it's now about 50% more performant than utility libraries.
Otherwise: You'll have to maintain less performant projects where you could have simply used what was already available or dealt with a few more lines in exchange of a few more files.

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too:


The possibilities are endless.
Building the Application
Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:


Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:


Deploying
While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.


It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

More About PyTorch
At a granular level, PyTorch is a library that consists of the following components:



Component
Description




torch
a Tensor library like NumPy, with strong GPU support


torch.autograd
a tape-based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations in torch


torch.jit
a compilation stack (TorchScript) to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code


torch.nn
a neural networks library deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibility


torch.multiprocessing
Python multiprocessing, but with magical memory sharing of torch Tensors across processes. Useful for data loading and Hogwild training


torch.utils
DataLoader and other utility functions for convenience



Usually one uses PyTorch either as:

a replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.
a deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.

Elaborating further:
A GPU-Ready Tensor Library
If you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a ndarray).

PyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU, and accelerates the
computation by a huge amount.
We provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs
such as slicing, indexing, math operations, linear algebra, reductions.
And they are fast!
Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd
PyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.
Most frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe and CNTK have a static view of the world.
One has to build a neural network, and reuse the same structure again and again.
Changing the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch.
With PyTorch, we use a technique called reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which allows you to
change the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. Our inspiration comes
from several research papers on this topic, as well as current and past work such as
torch-autograd,
autograd,
Chainer, etc.
While this technique is not unique to PyTorch, it's one of the fastest implementations of it to date.
You get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research.

Python First
PyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework.
It is built to be deeply integrated into Python.
You can use it naturally like you would use NumPy / SciPy / scikit-learn etc.
You can write your new neural network layers in Python itself, using your favorite libraries
and use packages such as Cython and Numba.
Our goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.
Imperative Experiences
PyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought and easy to use.
When you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn't an asynchronous view of the world.
When you drop into a debugger, or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.
The stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.
We hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.
Fast and Lean
PyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries
such as Intel MKL and NVIDIA (cuDNN, NCCL) to maximize speed.
At the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends
(TH, THC, THNN, THCUNN) are mature and have been tested for years.
Hence, PyTorch is quite fast – whether you run small or large neural networks.
The memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.
We've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that
your deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.
This enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.
Extensions Without Pain
Writing new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforward
and with minimal abstractions.
You can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch API
or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy.
If you want to write your layers in C/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.
There is no wrapper code that needs to be written. You can see a tutorial here and an example here.

 If the version of Visual Studio 2017 is lesser than 15.3.3, please update Visual Studio 2017 to the latest version along with installing ""VC++ 2017 version 15.4 v14.11 toolset"".
 There is no guarantee of the correct building with VC++ 2017 toolsets, others than version 15.4 v14.11.
 ""VC++ 2017 version 15.4 v14.11 toolset"" might be installed onto already installed Visual Studio 2017 by running its installation once again and checking the corresponding checkbox under ""Individual components""/""Compilers, build tools, and runtimes"".
For building against CUDA 8.0 Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 (version 14.0), and the patch are needed to be installed too.
The details of the patch can be found here.
NVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called ""Nsight Compute"". For installing it onto already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.
Be sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio 2017.

python setup.py install

Docker Image
Dockerfile is supplied to build images with cuda support and cudnn v7. You can pass -e PYTHON_VERSION=x.y flag to specify which Python version is to be used by Miniconda, or leave it unset to use the default. Build from pytorch repo directory as docker needs to copy git repo into docker filesystem while building the image.
docker build -t pytorch -f docker/pytorch/Dockerfile .

You can also pull a pre-built docker image from Docker Hub and run with nvidia-docker,
but this is not currently maintained and will pull PyTorch 0.2.
nvidia-docker run --rm -ti --ipc=host pytorch/pytorch:latest

Please note that PyTorch uses shared memory to share data between processes, so if torch multiprocessing is used (e.g.
for multithreaded data loaders) the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough, and you
should increase shared memory size either with --ipc=host or --shm-size command line options to nvidia-docker run.
Building the Documentation
To build documentation in various formats, you will need Sphinx and the
readthedocs theme.
cd docs/
pip install -r requirements.txt

You can then build the documentation by running make <format> from the
docs/ folder. Run make to get a list of all available output formats.
Previous Versions
Installation instructions and binaries for previous PyTorch versions may be found
on our website.

Tech Interview Handbook






Credits: Illustration by @yangheng



What is this?
Carefully curated content to help you ace your next technical interview, with a focus on algorithms. System design questions are in-progress. Besides the usual algorithm questions, other awesome stuff includes:

How to prepare for coding interviews
Interview Cheatsheet - Straight-to-the-point Do's and Don'ts 🆕
Algorithm tips and the best practice questions categorized by topic
""Front-end Job Interview Questions"" answers
Interview formats of the top tech companies
Behavioral questions categorized by companies
Good questions to ask your interviewers at the end of the interviews
Helpful resume tips to get your resume noticed and the Do's and Don'ts

This handbook is pretty new and help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!
Why do I want this?
This repository has practical content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful as well.
Who is this for?
Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.
How is this repository different?
There are so many awesome books like Cracking the Coding Interview and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top quality curated content directly for your consumption.
Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. 😎
Looking for Front End content?
Front end-related content have been extracted out into a separate repository - Front End Interview Handbook.
Contents

Preparing for a Coding Interview

Interview cheatsheet - Straight-to-the-point Do's and Don'ts


Algorithm Questions - Questions categorized by topics
Design Questions
Front-end Job Interview Questions and Answers 🔥⭐ - Answers to the famous ""Front-end Job Interview Questions""
Non-Technical Tips - Random non-technical tips that cover behavioral and psychological aspects, interview formats and ""Do you have any questions for me?""

Resume Tips
Behavioral Questions
Interview Formats
Psychological Tricks
Questions to Ask
Negotiation Tips


Utilities - Snippets of algorithms/code that will help in coding questions

UPDATE - Check out Lago, which is a Data Structures and Algorithms library that contains more high-quality implementations with 100% test coverage.



Related
If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out Lago, a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that is able to be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.
Contributing
There are no formal contributing guidelines at the moment as things are still in flux and we might find a better approach to structure content as we go along. You are welcome to contribute whatever you think will be helpful to fellow engineers. If you would like to contribute content for different domains, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request and we can discuss further.

Kotlin Programming Language
Welcome to Kotlin! Some handy links:

Kotlin Site
Getting Started Guide
Try Kotlin
Kotlin Standard Library
Issue Tracker
Forum
Kotlin Blog
Follow Kotlin on Twitter
Public Slack channel
TeamCity CI build

Editing Kotlin

Kotlin IntelliJ IDEA Plugin
Kotlin Eclipse Plugin
Kotlin Sublime Text Package

Build environment requirements
In order to build Kotlin distribution you need to have:


JDK 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 9


Setup environment variables as following:
  JAVA_HOME=""path to JDK 1.8""
  JDK_16=""path to JDK 1.6""
  JDK_17=""path to JDK 1.7""
  JDK_18=""path to JDK 1.8""
  JDK_9=""path to JDK 9""



For local development, if you're not working on bytecode generation or the standard library, it's OK to have only JDK 1.8 and JDK 9 installed, and to point JDK_16 and JDK_17 environment variables to your JDK 1.8 installation.
You also can use Gradle properties to setup JDK_* variables.

Note: The JDK 6 for MacOS is not available on Oracle's site. You can download it here.

On Windows you might need to add long paths setting to the repo:
git config core.longpaths true 

Building
The project is built with Gradle. Run Gradle to build the project and to run the tests
using the following command on Unix/macOS:
./gradlew <tasks-and-options>

or the following command on Windows:
gradlew <tasks-and-options>

On the first project configuration gradle will download and setup the dependencies on

intellij-core is a part of command line compiler and contains only necessary APIs.
idea-full is a full blown IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to be used in the plugin module.

These dependencies are quite large, so depending on the quality of your internet connection
you might face timeouts getting them. In this case you can increase timeout by specifying the following
command line parameters on the first run:
./gradlew -Dhttp.socketTimeout=60000 -Dhttp.connectionTimeout=60000

Important gradle tasks

clean - clean build results
dist - assembles the compiler distribution into dist/kotlinc/ folder
ideaPlugin - assembles the Kotlin IDEA plugin distribution into dist/artifacts/Kotlin folder
install - build and install all public artifacts into local maven repository
runIde - build IDEA plugin and run IDEA with it
coreLibsTest - build and run stdlib, reflect and kotlin-test tests
gradlePluginTest - build and run gradle plugin tests
compilerTest - build and run all compiler tests
ideaPluginTest - build and run all IDEA plugin tests

OPTIONAL: Some artifacts, mainly Maven plugin ones, are built separately with Maven.
Refer to libraries/ReadMe.md for details.
Building for different versions of IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio
Kotlin plugin is intended to work with several recent versions of IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio. Each platform is allowed to have a different set of features and might provide a slightly different API. Instead of using several parallel Git branches, project stores everything in a single branch, but files may have counterparts with version extensions (*.as32, *.172, *.181). The primary file is expected to be replaced with its counterpart when targeting non-default platform.
More detailed description of this scheme can be found at https://github.com/JetBrains/bunches/blob/master/ReadMe.md.
Usually, there's no need to care about multiple platforms as all features are enabled everywhere by default. Additional counterparts should be created if there's an expected difference in behavior or an incompatible API usage is required and there's no reasonable workaround to save source compatibility. Kotlin plugin contains a pre-commit check that shows a warning if a file has been updated without its counterparts.
Development for some particular platform is possible after 'switching' that can be done with Bunch Tool from the command line.
cd kotlin-project-dir

# switching to IntelliJ Idea 2018.2
bunch switch . 182
 Working with the project in IntelliJ IDEA
Working with the Kotlin project requires at least IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3. You can download IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3 here.
After cloning the project, to import the project in Intellij choose the project directory in the Open project dialog. Then, after project opened, Select
File -> New... -> Module from Existing Sources in the menu, and select build.gradle.kts file in the project's root folder.
In the import dialog, select use default gradle wrapper.
To be able to run tests from IntelliJ easily, check Delegate IDE build/run actions to Gradle and choose Gradle Test Runner in the Gradle runner settings after importing the project.
At this time, you can use the latest released 1.2.x version of the Kotlin plugin for working with the code. To make sure you have the latest version installed, use Tools | Kotlin | Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates and press ""Check for updates now"".
Compiling and running
From this root project there are Run/Debug Configurations for running IDEA or the Compiler Tests for example; so if you want to try out the latest and greatest IDEA plugin

VCS -> Git -> Pull
Run the ""IDEA"" run configuration in the project
a child IntelliJ IDEA with the Kotlin plugin will then startup

Including into composite build
To include kotlin compiler into composite build you need to define dependencySubstitution for kotlin-compiler module in settings.gradle
includeBuild('/path/to/kotlin') {
    dependencySubstitution {
        substitute module('org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compiler') with project(':include:kotlin-compiler')
    }
}

Git - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations
and full access to internals.
Git is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public
License version 2 (some parts of it are under different licenses,
compatible with the GPLv2). It was originally written by Linus
Torvalds with help of a group of hackers around the net.
Please read the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
Many Git online resources are accessible from https://git-scm.com/
including full documentation and Git related tools.
See Documentation/gittutorial.txt to get started, then see
Documentation/giteveryday.txt for a useful minimum set of commands, and
Documentation/git-.txt for documentation of each command.
If git has been correctly installed, then the tutorial can also be
read with man gittutorial or git help tutorial, and the
documentation of each command with man git-<commandname> or git help <commandname>.
CVS users may also want to read Documentation/gitcvs-migration.txt
(man gitcvs-migration or git help cvs-migration if git is
installed).
The user discussion and development of Git take place on the Git
mailing list -- everyone is welcome to post bug reports, feature
requests, comments and patches to git@vger.kernel.org (read
Documentation/SubmittingPatches for instructions on patch submission).
To subscribe to the list, send an email with just ""subscribe git"" in
the body to majordomo@vger.kernel.org. The mailing list archives are
available at https://public-inbox.org/git/,
http://marc.info/?l=git and other archival sites.
Issues which are security relevant should be disclosed privately to
the Git Security mailing list git-security@googlegroups.com.
The maintainer frequently sends the ""What's cooking"" reports that
list the current status of various development topics to the mailing
list.  The discussion following them give a good reference for
project status, development direction and remaining tasks.
The name ""git"" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very
first version. He described the tool as ""the stupid content tracker""
and the name as (depending on your mood):

random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
mispronunciation of ""get"" may or may not be relevant.
stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the
dictionary of slang.
""global information tracker"": you're in a good mood, and it actually
works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
""goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t"": when it breaks

Immutable collections for JavaScript
 
Immutable data cannot be changed once created, leading to much simpler
application development, no defensive copying, and enabling advanced memoization
and change detection techniques with simple logic. Persistent data presents
a mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always
yields new updated data.
Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures including:
List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record.
These data structures are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using
structural sharing via hash maps tries and vector tries as popularized
by Clojure and Scala, minimizing the need to copy or cache data.
Immutable.js also provides a lazy Seq, allowing efficient
chaining of collection methods like map and filter without creating
intermediate representations. Create some Seq with Range and Repeat.
Want to hear more? Watch the presentation about Immutable.js:

Getting started
Install immutable using npm.
npm install immutable
Then require it into any module.
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
map1.get('b') + "" vs. "" + map2.get('b'); // 2 vs. 50
Browser
Immutable.js has no dependencies, which makes it predictable to include in a Browser.
It's highly recommended to use a module bundler like webpack,
rollup, or
browserify. The immutable npm module works
without any additional consideration. All examples throughout the documentation
will assume use of this kind of tool.
Alternatively, Immutable.js may be directly included as a script tag. Download
or link to a CDN such as CDNJS
or jsDelivr.
Use a script tag to directly add Immutable to the global scope:
<script src=""immutable.min.js""></script>
<script>
  var map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
  var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
  map1.get('b'); // 2
  map2.get('b'); // 50
</script>
Or use an AMD-style loader (such as RequireJS):
require(['./immutable.min.js'], function (Immutable) {
  var map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
  var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
  map1.get('b'); // 2
  map2.get('b'); // 50
});
Flow & TypeScript
Use these Immutable collections and sequences as you would use native
collections in your Flowtype or TypeScript programs while still taking
advantage of type generics, error detection, and auto-complete in your IDE.
Installing immutable via npm brings with it type definitions for Flow (v0.55.0 or higher)
and TypeScript (v2.1.0 or higher), so you shouldn't need to do anything at all!
Using TypeScript with Immutable.js v4
Immutable.js type definitions embrace ES2015. While Immutable.js itself supports
legacy browsers and environments, its type definitions require TypeScript's 2015
lib. Include either ""target"": ""es2015"" or ""lib"": ""es2015"" in your
tsconfig.json, or provide --target es2015 or --lib es2015 to the
tsc command.
const { Map } = require(""immutable"");
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
map1.get('b') + "" vs. "" + map2.get('b'); // 2 vs. 50
Using TypeScript with Immutable.js v3 and earlier:
Previous versions of Immutable.js include a reference file which you can include
via relative path to the type definitions at the top of your file.
///<reference path='./node_modules/immutable/dist/immutable.d.ts'/>
import Immutable from require('immutable');
var map1: Immutable.Map<string, number>;
map1 = Immutable.Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
var map2 = map1.set('b', 50);
map1.get('b'); // 2
map2.get('b'); // 50
The case for Immutability
Much of what makes application development difficult is tracking mutation and
maintaining state. Developing with immutable data encourages you to think
differently about how data flows through your application.
Subscribing to data events throughout your application creates a huge overhead of
book-keeping which can hurt performance, sometimes dramatically, and creates
opportunities for areas of your application to get out of sync with each other
due to easy to make programmer error. Since immutable data never changes,
subscribing to changes throughout the model is a dead-end and new data can only
ever be passed from above.
This model of data flow aligns well with the architecture of React
and especially well with an application designed using the ideas of Flux.
When data is passed from above rather than being subscribed to, and you're only
interested in doing work when something has changed, you can use equality.
Immutable collections should be treated as values rather than objects. While
objects represent some thing which could change over time, a value represents
the state of that thing at a particular instance of time. This principle is most
important to understanding the appropriate use of immutable data. In order to
treat Immutable.js collections as values, it's important to use the
Immutable.is() function or .equals() method to determine value equality
instead of the === operator which determines object reference identity.
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
map1.equals(map2); // true
map1 === map2; // false
Note: As a performance optimization Immutable.js attempts to return the existing
collection when an operation would result in an identical collection, allowing
for using === reference equality to determine if something definitely has not
changed. This can be extremely useful when used within a memoization function
which would prefer to re-run the function if a deeper equality check could
potentially be more costly. The === equality check is also used internally by
Immutable.is and .equals() as a performance optimization.
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = map1.set('b', 2); // Set to same value
map1 === map2; // true
If an object is immutable, it can be ""copied"" simply by making another reference
to it instead of copying the entire object. Because a reference is much smaller
than the object itself, this results in memory savings and a potential boost in
execution speed for programs which rely on copies (such as an undo-stack).
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const map = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const mapCopy = map; // Look, ""copies"" are free!
JavaScript-first API
While Immutable.js is inspired by Clojure, Scala, Haskell and other functional
programming environments, it's designed to bring these powerful concepts to
JavaScript, and therefore has an Object-Oriented API that closely mirrors that
of ES2015 Array, Map, and Set.
The difference for the immutable collections is that methods which would mutate
the collection, like push, set, unshift or splice, instead return a new
immutable collection. Methods which return new arrays, like slice or concat,
instead return new immutable collections.
const { List } = require('immutable');
const list1 = List([ 1, 2 ]);
const list2 = list1.push(3, 4, 5);
const list3 = list2.unshift(0);
const list4 = list1.concat(list2, list3);
assert.equal(list1.size, 2);
assert.equal(list2.size, 5);
assert.equal(list3.size, 6);
assert.equal(list4.size, 13);
assert.equal(list4.get(0), 1);
Almost all of the methods on Array will be found in similar form on
Immutable.List, those of Map found on Immutable.Map, and those of Set
found on Immutable.Set, including collection operations like forEach()
and map().
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const alpha = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 });
alpha.map((v, k) => k.toUpperCase()).join();
// 'A,B,C,D'
Convert from raw JavaScript objects and arrays.
Designed to inter-operate with your existing JavaScript, Immutable.js
accepts plain JavaScript Arrays and Objects anywhere a method expects a
Collection.
const { Map, List } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 });
const map2 = Map({ c: 10, a: 20, t: 30 });
const obj = { d: 100, o: 200, g: 300 };
const map3 = map1.merge(map2, obj);
// Map { a: 20, b: 2, c: 10, d: 100, t: 30, o: 200, g: 300 }
const list1 = List([ 1, 2, 3 ]);
const list2 = List([ 4, 5, 6 ]);
const array = [ 7, 8, 9 ];
const list3 = list1.concat(list2, array);
// List [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
This is possible because Immutable.js can treat any JavaScript Array or Object
as a Collection. You can take advantage of this in order to get sophisticated
collection methods on JavaScript Objects, which otherwise have a very sparse
native API. Because Seq evaluates lazily and does not cache intermediate
results, these operations can be extremely efficient.
const { Seq } = require('immutable');
const myObject = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
Seq(myObject).map(x => x * x).toObject();
// { a: 1, b: 4, c: 9 }
Keep in mind, when using JS objects to construct Immutable Maps, that
JavaScript Object properties are always strings, even if written in a quote-less
shorthand, while Immutable Maps accept keys of any type.
const { fromJS } = require('immutable');

const obj = { 1: ""one"" };
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // [ ""1"" ]
console.log(obj[""1""], obj[1]); // ""one"", ""one""

const map = fromJS(obj);
console.log(map.get(""1""), map.get(1)); // ""one"", undefined
Property access for JavaScript Objects first converts the key to a string, but
since Immutable Map keys can be of any type the argument to get() is
not altered.
Converts back to raw JavaScript objects.
All Immutable.js Collections can be converted to plain JavaScript Arrays and
Objects shallowly with toArray() and toObject() or deeply with toJS().
All Immutable Collections also implement toJSON() allowing them to be passed
to JSON.stringify directly. They also respect the custom toJSON() methods of
nested objects.
const { Map, List } = require('immutable');
const deep = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: List([ 3, 4, 5 ]) });
console.log(deep.toObject()); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ] }
console.log(deep.toArray()); // [ 1, 2, List [ 3, 4, 5 ] ]
console.log(deep.toJS()); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] }
JSON.stringify(deep); // '{""a"":1,""b"":2,""c"":[3,4,5]}'
Embraces ES2015
Immutable.js supports all JavaScript environments, including legacy
browsers (even IE8). However it also takes advantage of features added to
JavaScript in ES2015, the latest standard version of JavaScript, including
Iterators, Arrow Functions, Classes, and Modules. It's inspired
by the native Map and Set collections added to ES2015.
All examples in the Documentation are presented in ES2015. To run in all
browsers, they need to be translated to ES5.
// ES2015
const mapped = foo.map(x => x * x);
// ES5
var mapped = foo.map(function (x) { return x * x; });
All Immutable.js collections are Iterable, which allows them to be
used anywhere an Iterable is expected, such as when spreading into an Array.
const { List } = require('immutable');
const aList = List([ 1, 2, 3 ]);
const anArray = [ 0, ...aList, 4, 5 ]; // [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
Note: A Collection is always iterated in the same order, however that order may
not always be well defined, as is the case for the Map and Set.
Nested Structures
The collections in Immutable.js are intended to be nested, allowing for deep
trees of data, similar to JSON.
const { fromJS } = require('immutable');
const nested = fromJS({ a: { b: { c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } });
// Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } }
A few power-tools allow for reading and operating on nested data. The
most useful are mergeDeep, getIn, setIn, and updateIn, found on List,
Map and OrderedMap.
const { fromJS } = require('immutable');
const nested = fromJS({ a: { b: { c: [ 3, 4, 5 ] } } });

const nested2 = nested.mergeDeep({ a: { b: { d: 6 } } });
// Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ], d: 6 } } }

console.log(nested2.getIn([ 'a', 'b', 'd' ])); // 6

const nested3 = nested2.updateIn([ 'a', 'b', 'd' ], value => value + 1);
console.log(nested3);
// Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5 ], d: 7 } } }

const nested4 = nested3.updateIn([ 'a', 'b', 'c' ], list => list.push(6));
// Map { a: Map { b: Map { c: List [ 3, 4, 5, 6 ], d: 7 } } }
Equality treats Collections as Values
Immutable.js collections are treated as pure data values. Two immutable
collections are considered value equal (via .equals() or is()) if they
represent the same collection of values. This differs from JavaScript's typical
reference equal (via === or ==) for Objects and Arrays which only
determines if two variables represent references to the same object instance.
Consider the example below where two identical Map instances are not
reference equal but are value equal.
// First consider:
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const obj2 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
obj1 !== obj2; // two different instances are always not equal with ===

const { Map, is } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
map1 !== map2; // two different instances are not reference-equal
map1.equals(map2); // but are value-equal if they have the same values
is(map1, map2); // alternatively can use the is() function
Value equality allows Immutable.js collections to be used as keys in Maps or
values in Sets, and retrieved with different but equivalent collections:
const { Map, Set } = require('immutable');
const map1 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const map2 = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const set = Set().add(map1);
set.has(map2); // true because these are value-equal
Note: is() uses the same measure of equality as Object.is for scalar
strings and numbers, but uses value equality for Immutable collections,
determining if both are immutable and all keys and values are equal
using the same measure of equality.
Performance tradeoffs
While value equality is useful in many circumstances, it has different
performance characteristics than reference equality. Understanding these
tradeoffs may help you decide which to use in each case, especially when used
to memoize some operation.
When comparing two collections, value equality may require considering every
item in each collection, on an O(N) time complexity. For large collections of
values, this could become a costly operation. Though if the two are not equal
and hardly similar, the inequality is determined very quickly. In contrast, when
comparing two collections with reference equality, only the initial references
to memory need to be compared which is not based on the size of the collections,
which has an O(1) time complexity. Checking reference equality is always very
fast, however just because two collections are not reference-equal does not rule
out the possibility that they may be value-equal.
Return self on no-op optimization
When possible, Immutable.js avoids creating new objects for updates where no
change in value occurred, to allow for efficient reference equality checking
to quickly determine if no change occurred.
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const originalMap = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const updatedMap = originalMap.set('b', 2);
updatedMap === originalMap; // No-op .set() returned the original reference.
However updates which do result in a change will return a new reference. Each
of these operations occur independently, so two similar updates will not return
the same reference:
const { Map } = require('immutable');
const originalMap = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const updatedMap = originalMap.set('b', 1000);
// New instance, leaving the original immutable.
updatedMap !== originalMap;
const anotherUpdatedMap = originalMap.set('b', 1000);
// Despite both the results of the same operation, each created a new reference.
anotherUpdatedMap !== updatedMap;
// However the two are value equal.
anotherUpdatedMap.equals(updatedMap);
Batching Mutations

If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound?
If a pure function mutates some local data in order to produce an immutable
return value, is that ok?
— Rich Hickey, Clojure

Applying a mutation to create a new immutable object results in some overhead,
which can add up to a minor performance penalty. If you need to apply a series
of mutations locally before returning, Immutable.js gives you the ability to
create a temporary mutable (transient) copy of a collection and apply a batch of
mutations in a performant manner by using withMutations. In fact, this is
exactly how  Immutable.js applies complex mutations itself.
As an example, building list2 results in the creation of 1, not 3, new
immutable Lists.
const { List } = require('immutable');
const list1 = List([ 1, 2, 3 ]);
const list2 = list1.withMutations(function (list) {
  list.push(4).push(5).push(6);
});
assert.equal(list1.size, 3);
assert.equal(list2.size, 6);
Note: Immutable.js also provides asMutable and asImmutable, but only
encourages their use when withMutations will not suffice. Use caution to not
return a mutable copy, which could result in undesired behavior.
Important!: Only a select few methods can be used in withMutations including
set, push and pop. These methods can be applied directly against a
persistent data-structure where other methods like map, filter, sort,
and splice will always return new immutable data-structures and never mutate
a mutable collection.
Lazy Seq
Seq describes a lazy operation, allowing them to efficiently chain
use of all the higher-order collection methods (such as map and filter)
by not creating intermediate collections.
Seq is immutable — Once a Seq is created, it cannot be
changed, appended to, rearranged or otherwise modified. Instead, any mutative
method called on a Seq will return a new Seq.
Seq is lazy — Seq does as little work as necessary to respond to any
method call. Values are often created during iteration, including implicit
iteration when reducing or converting to a concrete data structure such as
a List or JavaScript Array.
For example, the following performs no work, because the resulting
Seq's values are never iterated:
const { Seq } = require('immutable');
const oddSquares = Seq([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ])
  .filter(x => x % 2 !== 0)
  .map(x => x * x);
Once the Seq is used, it performs only the work necessary. In this
example, no intermediate arrays are ever created, filter is called three
times, and map is only called once:
oddSquares.get(1); // 9
Any collection can be converted to a lazy Seq with Seq().
const { Map, Seq } = require('immutable');
const map = Map({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
const lazySeq = Seq(map);
Seq allows for the efficient chaining of operations, allowing for the
expression of logic that can otherwise be very tedious:
lazySeq
  .flip()
  .map(key => key.toUpperCase())
  .flip();
// Seq { A: 1, B: 2, C: 3 }
As well as expressing logic that would otherwise seem memory or time
limited, for example Range is a special kind of Lazy sequence.
const { Range } = require('immutable');
Range(1, Infinity)
  .skip(1000)
  .map(n => -n)
  .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)
  .take(2)
  .reduce((r, n) => r * n, 1);

前言
README in English
初学vue时曾在网上搜索vue的实战项目源码，无奈大部分都是简单的demo，对于深究vue没有太大的帮助，剩下的一些大部分都是像音乐播放器之类的展示型项目，交互没有预期那么复杂。但我们实际在工作中，经常会遇到有购物车的项目，这类项目因为涉及到money，所以对逻辑严谨度要求高，页面之间交互复杂，又会伴随着登录、注册、用户信息等等，常常会让我们很头疼。既然还没人用vue写过这样的项目，那不如我来写，开源出来对能看到的人也会有帮助。
这种功能性的项目很实用但是往往也很枯燥，没有音乐播放器那么看起来绚丽，思来想去发现饿了么是一个不错的素材，一来它足够复杂，开放的外卖平台比一般的公司独有商店更加复杂。二来 见到那么多美食，大家也不会感觉到厌烦。
为啥是饿了么，而不是百度，美团？原因很简单，三个外卖大佬里，饿了么的色调和布局是最漂亮的，看起来最舒服。
此项目大大小小共 45 个页面，涉及注册、登录、商品展示、购物车、下单等等，是一个完整的流程。一般公司即便是官网的单页面项目都没这么复杂，如果这个项目能驾驭的了，相信大部分公司的其他单页面应用也就不在话下，即便更复杂，也不会比这个高到哪里去。
因为利用业余时间来做，年前就开始写，又跨个年，周期有点长，项目从零布局到完成共用了2个多月的时间，目前项目已经完成，正在进行一些性能的优化，增加详细的注释。
另外，这个项目和慕课网视频的那个饿了么没有任何关系，慕课网的项目只有一个页面，我在看完vue的官方文档后直接写了这个项目，没有参照任何人的代码，请大家不要混为一谈。
注：此项目纯属个人瞎搞，正常下单请选择饿了么官方客户端。
技术栈
vue2 + vuex + vue-router + webpack + ES6/7 + fetch + sass + flex + svg
项目运行
注意：由于涉及大量的 ES6/7 等新属性，node 需要 6.0 以上版本
git clone https://github.com/bailicangdu/vue2-elm.git  

cd vue2-elm

npm install 或 yarn(推荐)

npm run dev


关于接口数据
此项目的所有接口数据都来源于配套的后台系统，后台项目传送地址。
如果想体验前后台同时开发，可以下载后台系统。
此时启动本项目的命令为：npm run local 而不是 npm run dev。
同时我们也提供了基于element-ui搭建的后台管理页面
如果只做前端开发，请忽略上面这几句话哟～

总结
1、因为并不是elm官方，而且因为要开代理，必须在pc端打开，最多只能做到下单这一步，下单成功后可以在手机客户端查看并付款。
2、一般涉及到money的网页逻辑都比较复杂，尤其像饿了么这样一个开放的平台，商家和食品种类繁多，页面与页面之间交互复杂，在写到 购物车 和 下单 功能时众多的数据和逻辑一度让人很头疼，又没有设计和接口api文档，只能一步步摸索。
3、vue因其轻量级的框架在中小型项目中表现亮眼，在大型单页面应用中因为vuex的存在，表现依然出色，在处理复杂交互逻辑的时候，vuex的存在是不可或缺的。所以说利用 vue + vuex 完全可以去做大型的单页面项目。
4、项目写到现在，从 登录注册到、首页、搜索、商家列表、购物车、下单、订单列表、个人中心 一个流程走完之后、不但对vue的理解更深一层，而且对以后掌控大型项目的时候也有非常多的帮助，做一个实际的项目才能对自己有很大的提升。
5、曾一度怀疑，花几个月的时间做这样一个项目到底有没有意义，本来只是想做一个小项目练练手，没想到后来越写越多，不过坚持下来后我相信一切都是值得的。
6、项目已经完成，共45个页面。
最终目标
1、用node.js构建一个模拟外卖平台的后台系统。地址在这里
2、写出跨 Android 和 IOS 的原生APP版本。地址在这里
3、如果时间来的及，会出一卖家版本。
所以我的目的是构建一个横跨前后端，移动IOS、Android的完整生态圈。

Installation
To install Gin package, you need to install Go and set your Go workspace first.

The first need Go installed (version 1.8+ is required), then you can use the below Go command to install Gin.

$ go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin

Import it in your code:

import ""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""

(Optional) Import net/http. This is required for example if using constants such as http.StatusOK.

import ""net/http""
Use a vendor tool like Govendor

go get govendor

$ go get github.com/kardianos/govendor

Create your project folder and cd inside

$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/myusername/project && cd ""$_""

Vendor init your project and add gin

$ govendor init
$ govendor fetch github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.3

Copy a starting template inside your project

$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gin-gonic/examples/master/basic/main.go > main.go

Run your project

$ go run main.go
Prerequisite
Now Gin requires Go 1.8 or later and Go 1.10 will be required next major version.
Quick start
# assume the following codes in example.go file
$ cat example.go
package main

import ""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(200, gin.H{
			""message"": ""pong"",
		})
	})
	r.Run() // listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
}
# run example.go and visit 0.0.0.0:8080/ping on browser
$ go run example.go

Gin v1. stable

 Zero allocation router.
 Still the fastest http router and framework. From routing to writing.
 Complete suite of unit tests
 Battle tested
 API frozen, new releases will not break your code.

Build with jsoniter
Gin uses encoding/json as default json package but you can change to jsoniter by build from other tags.
$ go build -tags=jsoniter .
API Examples
You can find a number of ready-to-run examples at Gin examples repository.
Using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS
func main() {
	// Creates a gin router with default middleware:
	// logger and recovery (crash-free) middleware
	router := gin.Default()

	router.GET(""/someGet"", getting)
	router.POST(""/somePost"", posting)
	router.PUT(""/somePut"", putting)
	router.DELETE(""/someDelete"", deleting)
	router.PATCH(""/somePatch"", patching)
	router.HEAD(""/someHead"", head)
	router.OPTIONS(""/someOptions"", options)

	// By default it serves on :8080 unless a
	// PORT environment variable was defined.
	router.Run()
	// router.Run("":3000"") for a hard coded port
}
Parameters in path
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	// This handler will match /user/john but will not match /user/ or /user
	router.GET(""/user/:name"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		name := c.Param(""name"")
		c.String(http.StatusOK, ""Hello %s"", name)
	})

	// However, this one will match /user/john/ and also /user/john/send
	// If no other routers match /user/john, it will redirect to /user/john/
	router.GET(""/user/:name/*action"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		name := c.Param(""name"")
		action := c.Param(""action"")
		message := name + "" is "" + action
		c.String(http.StatusOK, message)
	})

	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Querystring parameters
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	// Query string parameters are parsed using the existing underlying request object.
	// The request responds to a url matching:  /welcome?firstname=Jane&lastname=Doe
	router.GET(""/welcome"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		firstname := c.DefaultQuery(""firstname"", ""Guest"")
		lastname := c.Query(""lastname"") // shortcut for c.Request.URL.Query().Get(""lastname"")

		c.String(http.StatusOK, ""Hello %s %s"", firstname, lastname)
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Multipart/Urlencoded Form
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	router.POST(""/form_post"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		message := c.PostForm(""message"")
		nick := c.DefaultPostForm(""nick"", ""anonymous"")

		c.JSON(200, gin.H{
			""status"":  ""posted"",
			""message"": message,
			""nick"":    nick,
		})
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Another example: query + post form
POST /post?id=1234&page=1 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=manu&message=this_is_great

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	router.POST(""/post"", func(c *gin.Context) {

		id := c.Query(""id"")
		page := c.DefaultQuery(""page"", ""0"")
		name := c.PostForm(""name"")
		message := c.PostForm(""message"")

		fmt.Printf(""id: %s; page: %s; name: %s; message: %s"", id, page, name, message)
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
id: 1234; page: 1; name: manu; message: this_is_great

Map as querystring or postform parameters
POST /post?ids[a]=1234&ids[b]=hello HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

names[first]=thinkerou&names[second]=tianou

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	router.POST(""/post"", func(c *gin.Context) {

		ids := c.QueryMap(""ids"")
		names := c.PostFormMap(""names"")

		fmt.Printf(""ids: %v; names: %v"", ids, names)
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
ids: map[b:hello a:1234], names: map[second:tianou first:thinkerou]

Upload files
Single file
References issue #774 and detail example code.
file.Filename SHOULD NOT be trusted. See Content-Disposition on MDN and #1693

The filename is always optional and must not be used blindly by the application: path information should be stripped, and conversion to the server file system rules should be done.

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	// Set a lower memory limit for multipart forms (default is 32 MiB)
	// router.MaxMultipartMemory = 8 << 20  // 8 MiB
	router.POST(""/upload"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// single file
		file, _ := c.FormFile(""file"")
		log.Println(file.Filename)

		// Upload the file to specific dst.
		// c.SaveUploadedFile(file, dst)

		c.String(http.StatusOK, fmt.Sprintf(""'%s' uploaded!"", file.Filename))
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
How to curl:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/upload \
  -F ""file=@/Users/appleboy/test.zip"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: multipart/form-data""
Multiple files
See the detail example code.
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	// Set a lower memory limit for multipart forms (default is 32 MiB)
	// router.MaxMultipartMemory = 8 << 20  // 8 MiB
	router.POST(""/upload"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// Multipart form
		form, _ := c.MultipartForm()
		files := form.File[""upload[]""]

		for _, file := range files {
			log.Println(file.Filename)

			// Upload the file to specific dst.
			// c.SaveUploadedFile(file, dst)
		}
		c.String(http.StatusOK, fmt.Sprintf(""%d files uploaded!"", len(files)))
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
How to curl:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/upload \
  -F ""upload[]=@/Users/appleboy/test1.zip"" \
  -F ""upload[]=@/Users/appleboy/test2.zip"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: multipart/form-data""
Grouping routes
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	// Simple group: v1
	v1 := router.Group(""/v1"")
	{
		v1.POST(""/login"", loginEndpoint)
		v1.POST(""/submit"", submitEndpoint)
		v1.POST(""/read"", readEndpoint)
	}

	// Simple group: v2
	v2 := router.Group(""/v2"")
	{
		v2.POST(""/login"", loginEndpoint)
		v2.POST(""/submit"", submitEndpoint)
		v2.POST(""/read"", readEndpoint)
	}

	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Blank Gin without middleware by default
Use
r := gin.New()
instead of
// Default With the Logger and Recovery middleware already attached
r := gin.Default()
Using middleware
func main() {
	// Creates a router without any middleware by default
	r := gin.New()

	// Global middleware
	// Logger middleware will write the logs to gin.DefaultWriter even if you set with GIN_MODE=release.
	// By default gin.DefaultWriter = os.Stdout
	r.Use(gin.Logger())

	// Recovery middleware recovers from any panics and writes a 500 if there was one.
	r.Use(gin.Recovery())

	// Per route middleware, you can add as many as you desire.
	r.GET(""/benchmark"", MyBenchLogger(), benchEndpoint)

	// Authorization group
	// authorized := r.Group(""/"", AuthRequired())
	// exactly the same as:
	authorized := r.Group(""/"")
	// per group middleware! in this case we use the custom created
	// AuthRequired() middleware just in the ""authorized"" group.
	authorized.Use(AuthRequired())
	{
		authorized.POST(""/login"", loginEndpoint)
		authorized.POST(""/submit"", submitEndpoint)
		authorized.POST(""/read"", readEndpoint)

		// nested group
		testing := authorized.Group(""testing"")
		testing.GET(""/analytics"", analyticsEndpoint)
	}

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
How to write log file
func main() {
    // Disable Console Color, you don't need console color when writing the logs to file.
    gin.DisableConsoleColor()

    // Logging to a file.
    f, _ := os.Create(""gin.log"")
    gin.DefaultWriter = io.MultiWriter(f)

    // Use the following code if you need to write the logs to file and console at the same time.
    // gin.DefaultWriter = io.MultiWriter(f, os.Stdout)

    router := gin.Default()
    router.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, ""pong"")
    })

    router.Run("":8080"")
}
Custom Log Format
func main() {
	router := gin.New()

	// LoggerWithFormatter middleware will write the logs to gin.DefaultWriter
	// By default gin.DefaultWriter = os.Stdout
	router.Use(gin.LoggerWithFormatter(func(param gin.LogFormatterParams) string {

		// your custom format
		return fmt.Sprintf(""%s - [%s] \""%s %s %s %d %s \""%s\"" %s\""\n"",
				param.ClientIP,
				param.TimeStamp.Format(time.RFC1123),
				param.Method,
				param.Path,
				param.Request.Proto,
				param.StatusCode,
				param.Latency,
				param.Request.UserAgent(),
				param.ErrorMessage,
		)
	}))
	router.Use(gin.Recovery())

	router.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.String(200, ""pong"")
	})

	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Sample Output
::1 - [Fri, 07 Dec 2018 17:04:38 JST] ""GET /ping HTTP/1.1 200 122.767µs ""Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/71.0.3578.80 Safari/537.36"" ""

Controlling Log output coloring
By default, logs output on console should be colorized depending on the detected TTY.
Never colorize logs:
func main() {
    // Disable log's color
    gin.DisableConsoleColor()
    
    // Creates a gin router with default middleware:
    // logger and recovery (crash-free) middleware
    router := gin.Default()
    
    router.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, ""pong"")
    })
    
    router.Run("":8080"")
}
Always colorize logs:
func main() {
    // Force log's color
    gin.ForceConsoleColor()
    
    // Creates a gin router with default middleware:
    // logger and recovery (crash-free) middleware
    router := gin.Default()
    
    router.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, ""pong"")
    })
    
    router.Run("":8080"")
}
Model binding and validation
To bind a request body into a type, use model binding. We currently support binding of JSON, XML, YAML and standard form values (foo=bar&boo=baz).
Gin uses go-playground/validator.v8 for validation. Check the full docs on tags usage here.
Note that you need to set the corresponding binding tag on all fields you want to bind. For example, when binding from JSON, set json:""fieldname"".
Also, Gin provides two sets of methods for binding:

Type - Must bind

Methods - Bind, BindJSON, BindXML, BindQuery, BindYAML
Behavior - These methods use MustBindWith under the hood. If there is a binding error, the request is aborted with c.AbortWithError(400, err).SetType(ErrorTypeBind). This sets the response status code to 400 and the Content-Type header is set to text/plain; charset=utf-8. Note that if you try to set the response code after this, it will result in a warning [GIN-debug] [WARNING] Headers were already written. Wanted to override status code 400 with 422. If you wish to have greater control over the behavior, consider using the ShouldBind equivalent method.


Type - Should bind

Methods - ShouldBind, ShouldBindJSON, ShouldBindXML, ShouldBindQuery, ShouldBindYAML
Behavior - These methods use ShouldBindWith under the hood. If there is a binding error, the error is returned and it is the developer's responsibility to handle the request and error appropriately.



When using the Bind-method, Gin tries to infer the binder depending on the Content-Type header. If you are sure what you are binding, you can use MustBindWith or ShouldBindWith.
You can also specify that specific fields are required. If a field is decorated with binding:""required"" and has a empty value when binding, an error will be returned.
// Binding from JSON
type Login struct {
	User     string `form:""user"" json:""user"" xml:""user""  binding:""required""`
	Password string `form:""password"" json:""password"" xml:""password"" binding:""required""`
}

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	// Example for binding JSON ({""user"": ""manu"", ""password"": ""123""})
	router.POST(""/loginJSON"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		var json Login
		if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&json); err != nil {
			c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{""error"": err.Error()})
			return
		}
		
		if json.User != ""manu"" || json.Password != ""123"" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{""status"": ""unauthorized""})
			return
		} 
		
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""status"": ""you are logged in""})
	})

	// Example for binding XML (
	//	<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
	//	<root>
	//		<user>user</user>
	//		<password>123</password>
	//	</root>)
	router.POST(""/loginXML"", func(c *gin.Context) {

		if xml.User != ""manu"" || xml.Password != ""123"" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{""status"": ""unauthorized""})
			return
		} 
		
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""status"": ""you are logged in""})
	})

	// Example for binding a HTML form (user=manu&password=123)
	router.POST(""/loginForm"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		var form Login
		// This will infer what binder to use depending on the content-type header.
		if err := c.ShouldBind(&form); err != nil {
			c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{""error"": err.Error()})
			return
		}
		
		if form.User != ""manu"" || form.Password != ""123"" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{""status"": ""unauthorized""})
			return
		} 
		
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""status"": ""you are logged in""})
	})

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	router.Run("":8080"")
}

Skip validate
When running the above example using the above the curl command, it returns error. Because the example use binding:""required"" for Password. If use binding:""-"" for Password, then it will not return error when running the above example again.
Custom Validators
It is also possible to register custom validators. See the example code.

	})

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run("":8080"")
}

	r.Run("":8080"")
}
PureJSON
Normally, JSON replaces special HTML characters with their unicode entities, e.g. < becomes  \u003c. If you want to encode such characters literally, you can use PureJSON instead.
This feature is unavailable in Go 1.6 and lower.
func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	
	// Serves unicode entities
	r.GET(""/json"", func(c *gin.Context) {

		}

		c.DataFromReader(http.StatusOK, contentLength, contentType, reader, extraHeaders)
	})
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
HTML rendering
Using LoadHTMLGlob() or LoadHTMLFiles()
func main() {

	html := template.Must(template.ParseFiles(""file1"", ""file2""))
	router.SetHTMLTemplate(html)
	router.Run("":8080"")
}
Custom Delimiters
You may use custom delims
	r := gin.Default()
	r.Delims(""{[{"", ""}]}"")
	r.LoadHTMLGlob(""/path/to/templates"")
Custom Template Funcs
See the detail example code.
main.go
import (
    ""fmt""
    ""html/template""
    ""net/http""
    ""time""

    ""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

func formatAsDate(t time.Time) string {
    year, month, day := t.Date()
    return fmt.Sprintf(""%d%02d/%02d"", year, month, day)
}

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()
    router.Delims(""{[{"", ""}]}"")
    router.SetFuncMap(template.FuncMap{
        ""formatAsDate"": formatAsDate,
    })
    router.LoadHTMLFiles(""./testdata/template/raw.tmpl"")

    router.GET(""/raw"", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.HTML(http.StatusOK, ""raw.tmpl"", map[string]interface{}{
            ""now"": time.Date(2017, 07, 01, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC),
        })
    })

    router.Run("":8080"")
}

raw.tmpl
Date: {[{.now | formatAsDate}]}
Result:
Date: 2017/07/01

Multitemplate
Gin allow by default use only one html.Template. Check a multitemplate render for using features like go 1.6 block template.
Redirects
Issuing a HTTP redirect is easy. Both internal and external locations are supported.
r.GET(""/test"", func(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Redirect(http.StatusMovedPermanently, ""http://www.google.com/"")
})
Issuing a Router redirect, use HandleContext like below.
r.GET(""/test"", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.Request.URL.Path = ""/test2""
    r.HandleContext(c)
})
r.GET(""/test2"", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{""hello"": ""world""})
})
Custom Middleware
func Logger() gin.HandlerFunc {
	return func(c *gin.Context) {
		t := time.Now()

		// Set example variable
		c.Set(""example"", ""12345"")

		// before request

		c.Next()

		// after request
		latency := time.Since(t)
		log.Print(latency)

		// access the status we are sending
		status := c.Writer.Status()
		log.Println(status)
	}
}

func main() {
	r := gin.New()
	r.Use(Logger())

	r.GET(""/test"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		example := c.MustGet(""example"").(string)

		// it would print: ""12345""
		log.Println(example)
	})

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
Using BasicAuth() middleware
// simulate some private data
var secrets = gin.H{
	""foo"":    gin.H{""email"": ""foo@bar.com"", ""phone"": ""123433""},
	""austin"": gin.H{""email"": ""austin@example.com"", ""phone"": ""666""},
	""lena"":   gin.H{""email"": ""lena@guapa.com"", ""phone"": ""523443""},
}

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	// Group using gin.BasicAuth() middleware
	// gin.Accounts is a shortcut for map[string]string
	authorized := r.Group(""/admin"", gin.BasicAuth(gin.Accounts{
		""foo"":    ""bar"",
		""austin"": ""1234"",
		""lena"":   ""hello2"",
		""manu"":   ""4321"",
	}))

	// /admin/secrets endpoint
	// hit ""localhost:8080/admin/secrets
	authorized.GET(""/secrets"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// get user, it was set by the BasicAuth middleware
		user := c.MustGet(gin.AuthUserKey).(string)
		if secret, ok := secrets[user]; ok {
			c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""user"": user, ""secret"": secret})
		} else {
			c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{""user"": user, ""secret"": ""NO SECRET :(""})
		}
	})

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
Goroutines inside a middleware
When starting new Goroutines inside a middleware or handler, you SHOULD NOT use the original context inside it, you have to use a read-only copy.
func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	r.GET(""/long_async"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// create copy to be used inside the goroutine
		cCp := c.Copy()
		go func() {
			// simulate a long task with time.Sleep(). 5 seconds
			time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)

			// note that you are using the copied context ""cCp"", IMPORTANT
			log.Println(""Done! in path "" + cCp.Request.URL.Path)
		}()
	})

	r.GET(""/long_sync"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		// simulate a long task with time.Sleep(). 5 seconds
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)

		// since we are NOT using a goroutine, we do not have to copy the context
		log.Println(""Done! in path "" + c.Request.URL.Path)
	})

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
Custom HTTP configuration
Use http.ListenAndServe() directly, like this:
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	http.ListenAndServe("":8080"", router)
}
or
func main() {
	router := gin.Default()

	s := &http.Server{
		Addr:           "":8080"",
		Handler:        router,
		ReadTimeout:    10 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
		MaxHeaderBytes: 1 << 20,
	}
	s.ListenAndServe()
}
Support Let's Encrypt

Run multiple service using Gin
See the question and try the following example:
package main

import (
	""log""
	""net/http""
	""time""

	""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
	""golang.org/x/sync/errgroup""
)

var (
	g errgroup.Group
)

func router01() http.Handler {
	e := gin.New()
	e.Use(gin.Recovery())
	e.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(
			http.StatusOK,
			gin.H{
				""code"":  http.StatusOK,
				""error"": ""Welcome server 01"",
			},
		)
	})

	return e
}

func router02() http.Handler {
	e := gin.New()
	e.Use(gin.Recovery())
	e.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(
			http.StatusOK,
			gin.H{
				""code"":  http.StatusOK,
				""error"": ""Welcome server 02"",
			},
		)
	})

	return e
}

func main() {
	server01 := &http.Server{
		Addr:         "":8080"",
		Handler:      router01(),
		ReadTimeout:  5 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
	}

	server02 := &http.Server{
		Addr:         "":8081"",
		Handler:      router02(),
		ReadTimeout:  5 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout: 10 * time.Second,
	}

	g.Go(func() error {
		return server01.ListenAndServe()
	})

	g.Go(func() error {
		return server02.ListenAndServe()
	})

	if err := g.Wait(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
Graceful restart or stop
Do you want to graceful restart or stop your web server?
There are some ways this can be done.
We can use fvbock/endless to replace the default ListenAndServe. Refer issue #296 for more details.
router := gin.Default()
router.GET(""/"", handler)
// [...]
endless.ListenAndServe("":4242"", router)
An alternative to endless:

manners: A polite Go HTTP server that shuts down gracefully.
graceful: Graceful is a Go package enabling graceful shutdown of an http.Handler server.
grace: Graceful restart & zero downtime deploy for Go servers.

If you are using Go 1.8, you may not need to use this library! Consider using http.Server's built-in Shutdown() method for graceful shutdowns. See the full graceful-shutdown example with gin.
// +build go1.8

package main

import (
	""context""
	""log""
	""net/http""
	""os""
	""os/signal""
	""syscall""
	""time""

	""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

func main() {
	router := gin.Default()
	router.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
		c.String(http.StatusOK, ""Welcome Gin Server"")
	})

	srv := &http.Server{
		Addr:    "":8080"",
		Handler: router,
	}

	go func() {
		// service connections
		if err := srv.ListenAndServe(); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf(""listen: %s\n"", err)
		}
	}()

	// Wait for interrupt signal to gracefully shutdown the server with
	// a timeout of 5 seconds.
	quit := make(chan os.Signal)
	// kill (no param) default send syscall.SIGTERM
	// kill -2 is syscall.SIGINT
	// kill -9 is syscall.SIGKILL but can""t be catch, so don't need add it
	signal.Notify(quit, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
	<-quit
	log.Println(""Shutdown Server ..."")

	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
	defer cancel()
	if err := srv.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(""Server Shutdown:"", err)
	}
	// catching ctx.Done(). timeout of 5 seconds.
	select {
	case <-ctx.Done():
		log.Println(""timeout of 5 seconds."")
	}
	log.Println(""Server exiting"")
}
Build a single binary with templates
You can build a server into a single binary containing templates by using go-assets.
func main() {
	r := gin.New()

	t, err := loadTemplate()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	r.SetHTMLTemplate(t)

	r.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.HTML(http.StatusOK, ""/html/index.tmpl"",nil)
	})
	r.Run("":8080"")
}

// loadTemplate loads templates embedded by go-assets-builder
func loadTemplate() (*template.Template, error) {
	t := template.New("""")
	for name, file := range Assets.Files {
		if file.IsDir() || !strings.HasSuffix(name, "".tmpl"") {
			continue
		}
		h, err := ioutil.ReadAll(file)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		t, err = t.New(name).Parse(string(h))
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
	}
	return t, nil
}
See a complete example in the https://github.com/gin-gonic/examples/tree/master/assets-in-binary directory.
Bind form-data request with custom struct
The follow example using custom struct:
type StructA struct {
    FieldA string `form:""field_a""`
}

type StructB struct {
    NestedStruct StructA
    FieldB string `form:""field_b""`
}

type StructC struct {
    NestedStructPointer *StructA
    FieldC string `form:""field_c""`
}

type StructD struct {
    NestedAnonyStruct struct {
        FieldX string `form:""field_x""`
    }
    FieldD string `form:""field_d""`
}

func GetDataB(c *gin.Context) {
    var b StructB
    c.Bind(&b)
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{
        ""a"": b.NestedStruct,
        ""b"": b.FieldB,
    })
}

func GetDataC(c *gin.Context) {
    var b StructC
    c.Bind(&b)
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{
        ""a"": b.NestedStructPointer,
        ""c"": b.FieldC,
    })
}

func GetDataD(c *gin.Context) {
    var b StructD
    c.Bind(&b)
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{
        ""x"": b.NestedAnonyStruct,
        ""d"": b.FieldD,
    })
}

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET(""/getb"", GetDataB)
    r.GET(""/getc"", GetDataC)
    r.GET(""/getd"", GetDataD)

    r.Run()
}
Using the command curl command result:
$ curl ""http://localhost:8080/getb?field_a=hello&field_b=world""
{""a"":{""FieldA"":""hello""},""b"":""world""}
$ curl ""http://localhost:8080/getc?field_a=hello&field_c=world""
{""a"":{""FieldA"":""hello""},""c"":""world""}
$ curl ""http://localhost:8080/getd?field_x=hello&field_d=world""
{""d"":""world"",""x"":{""FieldX"":""hello""}}

Try to bind body into different structs
The normal methods for binding request body consumes c.Request.Body and they
cannot be called multiple times.
type formA struct {
  Foo string `json:""foo"" xml:""foo"" binding:""required""`
}

type formB struct {
  Bar string `json:""bar"" xml:""bar"" binding:""required""`
}

func SomeHandler(c *gin.Context) {
  objA := formA{}
  objB := formB{}
  // This c.ShouldBind consumes c.Request.Body and it cannot be reused.
  if errA := c.ShouldBind(&objA); errA == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formA`)
  // Always an error is occurred by this because c.Request.Body is EOF now.
  } else if errB := c.ShouldBind(&objB); errB == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formB`)
  } else {
    ...
  }
}
For this, you can use c.ShouldBindBodyWith.
func SomeHandler(c *gin.Context) {
  objA := formA{}
  objB := formB{}
  // This reads c.Request.Body and stores the result into the context.
  if errA := c.ShouldBindBodyWith(&objA, binding.JSON); errA == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formA`)
  // At this time, it reuses body stored in the context.
  } else if errB := c.ShouldBindBodyWith(&objB, binding.JSON); errB == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formB JSON`)
  // And it can accepts other formats
  } else if errB2 := c.ShouldBindBodyWith(&objB, binding.XML); errB2 == nil {
    c.String(http.StatusOK, `the body should be formB XML`)
  } else {
    ...
  }
}

c.ShouldBindBodyWith stores body into the context before binding. This has
a slight impact to performance, so you should not use this method if you are
enough to call binding at once.
This feature is only needed for some formats -- JSON, XML, MsgPack,
ProtoBuf. For other formats, Query, Form, FormPost, FormMultipart,
can be called by c.ShouldBind() multiple times without any damage to
performance (See #1341).

http2 server push
http.Pusher is supported only go1.8+. See the golang blog for detail information.
package main

import (
	""html/template""
	""log""

	""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

var html = template.Must(template.New(""https"").Parse(`
<html>
<head>
  <title>Https Test</title>
  <script src=""/assets/app.js""></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style=""color:red;"">Welcome, Ginner!</h1>
</body>
</html>
`))

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.Static(""/assets"", ""./assets"")
	r.SetHTMLTemplate(html)

	r.GET(""/"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		if pusher := c.Writer.Pusher(); pusher != nil {
			// use pusher.Push() to do server push
			if err := pusher.Push(""/assets/app.js"", nil); err != nil {
				log.Printf(""Failed to push: %v"", err)
			}
		}
		c.HTML(200, ""https"", gin.H{
			""status"": ""success"",
		})
	})

	// Listen and Server in https://127.0.0.1:8080
	r.RunTLS("":8080"", ""./testdata/server.pem"", ""./testdata/server.key"")
}
Define format for the log of routes
The default log of routes is:
[GIN-debug] POST   /foo                      --> main.main.func1 (3 handlers)
[GIN-debug] GET    /bar                      --> main.main.func2 (3 handlers)
[GIN-debug] GET    /status                   --> main.main.func3 (3 handlers)

If you want to log this information in given format (e.g. JSON, key values or something else), then you can define this format with gin.DebugPrintRouteFunc.
In the example below, we log all routes with standard log package but you can use another log tools that suits of your needs.
import (
	""log""
	""net/http""

	""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	gin.DebugPrintRouteFunc = func(httpMethod, absolutePath, handlerName string, nuHandlers int) {
		log.Printf(""endpoint %v %v %v %v\n"", httpMethod, absolutePath, handlerName, nuHandlers)
	}

	r.POST(""/foo"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, ""foo"")
	})

	r.GET(""/bar"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, ""bar"")
	})

	r.GET(""/status"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, ""ok"")
	})

	// Listen and Server in http://0.0.0.0:8080
	r.Run()
}
Set and get a cookie
import (
    ""fmt""

    ""github.com/gin-gonic/gin""
)

func main() {

    router := gin.Default()

    router.GET(""/cookie"", func(c *gin.Context) {

        cookie, err := c.Cookie(""gin_cookie"")

        if err != nil {
            cookie = ""NotSet""
            c.SetCookie(""gin_cookie"", ""test"", 3600, ""/"", ""localhost"", false, true)
        }

        fmt.Printf(""Cookie value: %s \n"", cookie)
    })

    router.Run()
}
Testing
The net/http/httptest package is preferable way for HTTP testing.
package main

func setupRouter() *gin.Engine {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET(""/ping"", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.String(200, ""pong"")
	})
	return r
}

func main() {
	r := setupRouter()
	r.Run("":8080"")
}
Test for code example above:
package main

import (
	""net/http""
	""net/http/httptest""
	""testing""

	""github.com/stretchr/testify/assert""
)

func TestPingRoute(t *testing.T) {
	router := setupRouter()

	w := httptest.NewRecorder()
	req, _ := http.NewRequest(""GET"", ""/ping"", nil)
	router.ServeHTTP(w, req)

	assert.Equal(t, 200, w.Code)
	assert.Equal(t, ""pong"", w.Body.String())
}

Slate helps you create beautiful, intelligent, responsive API documentation.

The example above was created with Slate. Check it out at lord.github.io/slate.
Features


Clean, intuitive design — With Slate, the description of your API is on the left side of your documentation, and all the code examples are on the right side. Inspired by Stripe's and PayPal's API docs. Slate is responsive, so it looks great on tablets, phones, and even in print.


Everything on a single page — Gone are the days when your users had to search through a million pages to find what they wanted. Slate puts the entire documentation on a single page. We haven't sacrificed linkability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.


Slate is just Markdown — When you write docs with Slate, you're just writing Markdown, which makes it simple to edit and understand. Everything is written in Markdown — even the code samples are just Markdown code blocks.


Write code samples in multiple languages — If your API has bindings in multiple programming languages, you can easily put in tabs to switch between them. In your document, you'll distinguish different languages by specifying the language name at the top of each code block, just like with GitHub Flavored Markdown.


Out-of-the-box syntax highlighting for over 100 languages, no configuration required.


Automatic, smoothly scrolling table of contents on the far left of the page. As you scroll, it displays your current position in the document. It's fast, too. We're using Slate at TripIt to build documentation for our new API, where our table of contents has over 180 entries. We've made sure that the performance remains excellent, even for larger documents.


Let your users update your documentation for you — By default, your Slate-generated documentation is hosted in a public GitHub repository. Not only does this mean you get free hosting for your docs with GitHub Pages, but it also makes it simple for other developers to make pull requests to your docs if they find typos or other problems. Of course, if you don't want to use GitHub, you're also welcome to host your docs elsewhere.


RTL Support Full right-to-left layout for RTL languages such as Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Hebrew etc.


Getting started with Slate is super easy! Simply fork this repository and follow the instructions below. Or, if you'd like to check out what Slate is capable of, take a look at the sample docs.
Getting Started with Slate
Prerequisites
You're going to need:

Linux or macOS — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer
Bundler — If Ruby is already installed, but the bundle command doesn't work, just run gem install bundler in a terminal.

Getting Set Up

Fork this repository on GitHub.
Clone your forked repository (not our original one) to your hard drive with git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/slate.git
cd slate
Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!
Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about editing Slate markdown, or how to publish your docs.
If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available in the wiki.
Note on JavaScript Runtime
For those who don't have JavaScript runtime or are experiencing JavaScript runtime issues with ExecJS, it is recommended to add the rubyracer gem to your gemfile and run bundle again.

Tesseract OCR







About
This package contains an OCR engine - libtesseract and a command line program - tesseract.
Tesseract 4 adds a new neural net (LSTM) based OCR engine which is focused
on line recognition, but also still supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of
Tesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns. Compatibility with
Tesseract 3 is enabled by using the Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0).
It also needs traineddata files which support the legacy engine, for example
those from the tessdata repository.
The lead developer is Ray Smith. The maintainer is Zdenko Podobny.
For a list of contributors see AUTHORS
and GitHub's log of contributors.
Tesseract has unicode (UTF-8) support, and can recognize more than 100 languages ""out of the box"".
Tesseract supports various output formats: plain text, hOCR (HTML), PDF, invisible-text-only PDF, TSV. The master branch also has experimental support for ALTO (XML) output.
You should note that in many cases, in order to get better OCR results, you'll need to improve the quality of the image you are giving Tesseract.
This project does not include a GUI application. If you need one, please see the 3rdParty wiki page.
Tesseract can be trained to recognize other languages. See Tesseract Training for more information.
Brief history
Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol and
at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some
more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998.
In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. Since 2006 it is developed by Google.
The latest (LSTM based) stable version is 4.0.0, released on October 29, 2018. Latest source code for 4.0 is available from master branch on GitHub. Open issues can be found in issue tracker, and Planning wiki.
The latest 3.5 version is 3.05.02, released on June 19, 2018. Latest source code for 3.05 is available from 3.05 branch on GitHub. There is no development for this version, but it can be used for special cases (e.g. see Regression of features from 3.0x).
See Release Notes and Change Log for more details of the releases.
Installing Tesseract
You can either Install Tesseract via pre-built binary package or build it from source.
Supported Compilers are:

GCC 4.8 and above
Clang 3.4 and above
MSVC 2015, 2017

Other compilers might work, but are not officially supported.
Running Tesseract
Basic command line usage:
tesseract imagename outputbase [-l lang] [--oem ocrenginemode] [--psm pagesegmode] [configfiles...]

For more information about the various command line options use tesseract --help or man tesseract.
Examples can be found in the wiki.
For developers
Developers can use libtesseract C or C++ API to build their own application. If you need bindings to libtesseract for other programming languages, please see the wrapper section on AddOns wiki page.
Documentation of Tesseract generated from source code by doxygen can be found on tesseract-ocr.github.io.

PDF.js 
PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.
PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla Labs. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.
Contributing
PDF.js is an open source project and always looking for more contributors. To
get involved, visit:

Issue Reporting Guide
Code Contribution Guide
Frequently Asked Questions
Good Beginner Bugs
Projects

Feel free to stop by #pdfjs on irc.mozilla.org for questions or guidance.
Getting Started
Online demo

https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

Browser Extensions
Firefox
PDF.js is built into version 19+ of Firefox.
Chrome

The official extension for Chrome can be installed from the Chrome Web Store.
This extension is maintained by @Rob--W.
Build Your Own - Get the code as explained below and issue gulp chromium. Then open
Chrome, go to Tools > Extension and load the (unpackaged) extension from the
directory build/chromium.

Getting the Code
To get a local copy of the current code, clone it using git:
$ git clone https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git
$ cd pdf.js

Next, install Node.js via the official package or via
nvm. You need to install the gulp package
globally (see also gulp's getting started):
$ npm install -g gulp-cli

If everything worked out, install all dependencies for PDF.js:
$ npm install

Finally, you need to start a local web server as some browsers do not allow opening
PDF files using a file:// URL. Run:
$ gulp server

and then you can open:

http://localhost:8888/web/viewer.html

Please keep in mind that this requires an ES6 compatible browser; refer to Building PDF.js for usage with older browsers.
It is also possible to view all test PDF files on the right side by opening:

http://localhost:8888/test/pdfs/?frame

Building PDF.js
In order to bundle all src/ files into two production scripts and build the generic
viewer, run:
$ gulp generic

This will generate pdf.js and pdf.worker.js in the build/generic/build/ directory.
Both scripts are needed but only pdf.js needs to be included since pdf.worker.js will
be loaded by pdf.js. The PDF.js files are large and should be minified for production.
Using PDF.js in a web application
To use PDF.js in a web application you can choose to use a pre-built version of the library
or to build it from source. We supply pre-built versions for usage with NPM and Bower under
the pdfjs-dist name. For more information and examples please refer to the
wiki page on this subject.
Including via a CDN
PDF.js is hosted on several free CDNs:

https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/pdfjs-dist
https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js
https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist/

Learning
You can play with the PDF.js API directly from your browser using the live demos below:

Interactive examples

More examples can be found in the examples folder. Some of them are using the pdfjs-dist package, which can be built and installed in this repo directory via gulp dist-install command.
For an introduction to the PDF.js code, check out the presentation by our
contributor Julian Viereck:

Hackathon Starter
  
Live Demo: https://hackathon-starter-2018.herokuapp.com
Jump to What's new?
A boilerplate for Node.js web applications.
If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to
get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework,
pick a CSS framework. A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then
can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as Sign in with Facebook
authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.
When I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use.
I also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps,
without being too specific. In the worst case, you can use this as a learning guide for your projects,
if for example you are only interested in Sign in with Google authentication and nothing else.

Prerequisites

MongoDB
Node.js 8.0+
Command Line Tools
 Mac OS X: Xcode (or OS X 10.9+: xcode-select --install)
 Windows: Visual Studio OR Visual Studio Code + Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu
 Ubuntu /  Linux Mint: sudo apt-get install build-essential
 Fedora: sudo dnf groupinstall ""Development Tools""
 OpenSUSE: sudo zypper install --type pattern devel_basis

Note: If you are new to Node or Express, I recommend to watch
Node.js and Express 101
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB.
Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
Warning: If you want to use some API that need https to work (for example Pinterest or facebook),
you will need to download ngrok.
You must start ngrok after starting the project.
# start ngrok to intercept the data exchanged on port 8080
./ngrok http 8080
Next, you must use the https URL defined by ngrok, for example, https://hackaton.ngrok.io
Note: I highly recommend installing Nodemon.
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of node app.js use nodemon app.js. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
sudo npm install -g nodemon.
Obtaining API Keys
To use any of the included APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need
to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or
Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new
credentials.
Hackathon Starter 2.0 Update: I have included dummy keys and passwords for
all API examples to get you up and running even faster. But don't forget to update
them with your credentials when you are ready to deploy an app.


Visit Google Cloud Console
Click on the Create Project button
Enter Project Name, then click on Create button

Pro Tips

When installing an NPM package, add a --save flag, and it will be automatically
added to package.json as well. For example, npm install --save moment.
Use async.parallel() when you need to run multiple
asynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might want to scrape three different websites for some data and render the results in a template after all three websites have been scraped.
Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use _.find
function from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a
Twitter token from database: var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });,
where 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.

FAQ
Why do I get 403 Error: Forbidden when submitting a form?
You need to add the following hidden input element to your form. This has been
added in the pull request #40
as part of the CSRF protection.
input(type='hidden', name='_csrf', value=_csrf)

Note: It is now possible to whitelist certain URLs. In other words you can
specify a list of routes that should bypass CSRF verification check.
Note 2: To whitelist dynamic URLs use regular expression tests inside the
CSRF middleware to see if req.originalUrl matches your desired pattern.
I am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?
That's a custom error message defined in app.js to indicate that there was a
problem connecting to MongoDB:
mongoose.connection.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error(err);
  console.log('%s MongoDB connection error. Please make sure MongoDB is running.', chalk.red('✗'));
  process.exit();
});
You need to have a MongoDB server running before launching app.js. You can
download MongoDB here, or install it via a package manager.

Windows users, read Install MongoDB on Windows.
Tip: If you are always connected to the internet, you could just use
MongoDB Atlas or Compose instead
of downloading and installing MongoDB locally. You will only need to update database credentials
in .env file.
I get an error when I deploy my app, why?
Chances are you haven't changed the Database URI in .env. If MONGODB is
set to localhost, it will only work on your machine as long as MongoDB is
running. When you deploy to Heroku, OpenShift or some other provider, you will not have MongoDB
running on localhost. You need to create an account with MongoDB Atlas
or Compose, then create a free tier database.
See Deployment for more information on how to setup an account
and a new database step-by-step with MongoDB Atlas.
Why Pug (Jade) instead of Handlebars?
When I first started this project I didn't have any experience with Handlebars. Since then I have worked on Ember.js apps and got myself familiar with the Handlebars syntax. While it is true Handlebars is easier, because it looks like good old HTML, I have no regrets picking Jade over Handlebars. First off, it's the default template engine in Express, so someone who has built Express apps in the past already knows it. Secondly, I find extends and block to be indispensable, which as far as I know, Handlebars does not have out of the box. And lastly, subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.
Why do you have all routes defined in app.js?
For the sake of simplicity. While there might be a better approach,
such as passing app context to each controller as outlined in this
blog,
I find such style to be confusing for beginners.
It took me a long time to grasp the concept of exports and module.exports,
let alone having a global app reference in other files.
That to me is backward thinking.
The app.js is the ""heart of the app"", it should be the one referencing
models, routes, controllers, etc.
When working solo on small projects, I prefer to have everything inside app.js as is the case with this
REST API server.
How do I switch SendGrid for another email delivery service, like Mailgun or SparkPost?
Inside the nodemailer.createTransport method arguments, change the service from 'Sendgrid' to some other email service. Also, be sure to update both username and password below that. See the list of all supported services by Nodemailer.
How It Works (mini guides)
This section is intended for giving you a detailed explanation of
how a particular functionality works. Maybe you are just curious about
how it works, or perhaps you are lost and confused while reading the code,
I hope it provides some guidance to you.
Custom HTML and CSS Design 101
HTML5 UP has many beautiful templates that you can download for free.
When you download the ZIP file, it will come with index.html, images, css and js folders. So, how do you
integrate it with Hackathon Starter? Hackathon Starter uses Bootstrap CSS framework, but these templates do not.
Trying to use both CSS files at the same time will likely result in undesired effects.
Note: Using the custom templates approach, you should understand that you cannot reuse any of the views I have created: layout, home page, api browser, login, signup, account management, contact. Those views were built using Bootstrap grid and styles. You will have to manually update the grid using a different syntax provided in the template. Having said that, you can mix and match if you want to do so: Use Bootstrap for main app interface, and a custom template for a landing page.
Let's start from the beginning. For this example I will use Escape Velocity template:

Note: For the sake of simplicity I will only consider index.html, and skip left-sidebar.html,
no-sidebar.html, right-sidebar.html.
Move all JavaScript files from html5up-escape-velocity/js to public/js. Then move all CSS files from html5up-escape-velocity/css to public/css. And finally, move all images from html5up-escape-velocity/images to public/images. You could move it to the existing img folder, but that would require manually changing every img reference. Grab the contents of index.html and paste it into HTML To Pug.
Note: Do not forget to update all the CSS and JS paths accordingly.
Create a new file escape-velocity.pug and paste the Pug markup in views folder.
Whenever you see the code res.render('account/login') - that means it will search for views/account/login.pug file.
Let's see how it looks. Create a new controller escapeVelocity inside controllers/home.js:
exports.escapeVelocity = (req, res) => {
  res.render('escape-velocity', {
    title: 'Landing Page'
  });
};
And then create a route in app.js. I placed it right after the index controller:
app.get('/escape-velocity', homeController.escapeVelocity);
Restart the server (if you are not using nodemon); then you should see the new template at http://localhost:8080/escape-velocity.
I will stop right here, but if you would like to use this template as more than just a single page, take a look at how these Pug templates work: layout.pug - base template, index.pug - home page, partials/header.pug - Bootstrap navbar, partials/footer.pug - sticky footer. You will have to manually break it apart into smaller pieces. Figure out which part of the template you want to keep the same on all pages - that's your new layout.pug.
Then, each page that changes, be it index.pug, about.pug, contact.pug
will be embedded in your new layout.pug via block content. Use existing templates as a reference.
This is a rather lengthy process, and templates you get from elsewhere might have yet another grid system. That's why I chose Bootstrap for the Hackathon Starter.
Many people are already familiar with Bootstrap, plus it's easy to get started with it if you have never used Bootstrap.
You can also buy many beautifully designed Bootstrap themes at Themeforest, and use them as a drop-in replacement for Hackathon Starter. However, if you would like to go with a completely custom HTML/CSS design, this should help you to get started!

How do flash messages work in this project?
Flash messages allow you to display a message at the end of the request and access
it on next request and only next request. For instance, on a failed login attempt, you would
display an alert with some error message, but as soon as you refresh that page or visit a different
page and come back to the login page, that error message will be gone. It is only displayed once.
This project uses express-flash module for flash messages. And that
module is built on top of connect-flash, which is what I used in
this project initially. With express-flash you don't have to
explicitly send a flash message to every view inside res.render().
All flash messages are available in your views via messages object by default,
thanks to express-flash.
Flash messages have a two-step process. You use req.flash('errors', { msg: 'Error messages goes here' }
to create a flash message in your controllers, and then display them in your views:
if messages.errors
  .alert.alert-danger.fade.in
    for error in messages.errors
      div= error.msg
In the first step, 'errors' is the name of a flash message, which should match the
name of the property on messages object in your views. You place alert messages
inside if message.errors because you don't want to show them flash messages are present.
The reason why you pass an error like { msg: 'Error message goes here' } instead
of just a string - 'Error message goes here', is for the sake of consistency.
To clarify that, express-validator module which is used for validating and sanitizing user's input,
returns all errors as an array of objects, where each object has a msg property with a message why an error has occurred. Here is a more general example of what express-validator returns when there are errors present:
[
  { param: ""name"", msg: ""Name is required"", value: ""<received input>"" },
  { param: ""email"", msg: ""A valid email is required"", value: ""<received input>"" }
]
To keep consistent with that style, you should pass all flash messages
as { msg: 'My flash message' } instead of a string. Otherwise, you will see an alert box
without an error message. That is because in partials/flash.pug template it will try to output
error.msg (i.e. ""My flash message"".msg), in other words, it will try to call a msg method on a String object,
which will return undefined. Everything I just mentioned about errors, also applies
to ""info"" and ""success"" flash messages, and you could even create a new one yourself, such as:
Data Usage Controller (Example)
req.flash('warning', { msg: 'You have exceeded 90% of your data usage' });

User Account Page (Example)
if messages.warning
  .alert.alert-warning.fade.in
    for warning in messages.warning
      div= warning.msg
partials/flash.pug is a partial template that contains how flash messages
are formatted. Previously, flash
messages were scattered throughout each view that used flash messages
(contact, login, signup, profile), but now, thankfully it uses a DRY approach.
The flash messages partial template is included in the layout.pug, along with footer and navigation.
body
    include partials/header

    .container
      include partials/flash
      block content

    include partials/footer
If you have any further questions about flash messages,
please feel free to open an issue, and I will update this mini-guide accordingly,
or send a pull request if you would like to include something that I missed.

How do I create a new page?
A more correct way to say this would be ""How do I create a new route?"" The main file app.js contains all the routes.
Each route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see three or more arguments for a route. In a case like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments
are what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from
continuing forward, you won't get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication.
app.get('/account', passportConfig.isAuthenticated, userController.getAccount);
It always goes from left to right. A user visits /account page. Then isAuthenticated middleware checks if you are authenticated:
exports.isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/login');
};
If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your ""door"" by calling return next();. It then proceeds to the
next middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on GET requests or redirects on POST requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to the Account Management page; otherwise, you will be redirected to the Login page.
exports.getAccount = (req, res) => {
  res.render('account/profile', {
    title: 'Account Management'
  });
};
Express.js has app.get, app.post, app.put, app.delete, but for the most part, you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API.
If you just want to display a page, then use GET, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use POST.
Here is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building a page that lists all books from the database.
Step 1. Start by defining a route.
app.get('/books', bookController.getBooks);

Note: As of Express 4.x you can define your routes like so:
app.route('/books')
  .get(bookController.getBooks)
  .post(bookController.createBooks)
  .put(bookController.updateBooks)
  .delete(bookController.deleteBooks)
And here is how a route would look if it required an authentication and an authorization middleware:
app.route('/api/twitter')
  .all(passportConfig.isAuthenticated)
  .all(passportConfig.isAuthorized)
  .get(apiController.getTwitter)
  .post(apiController.postTwitter)
Use whichever style that makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I think that chaining HTTP verbs on app.route is a very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand, I can no longer see all my routes at a glance when you have one route per line.
Step 2. Create a new schema and a model Book.js inside the models directory.
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
});

const Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
module.exports = Book;
Step 3. Create a new controller file called book.js inside the controllers directory.
/**
 * GET /books
 * List all books.
 */
const Book = require('../models/Book.js');

exports.getBooks = (req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
};
Step 4. Import that controller in app.js.
const bookController = require('./controllers/book');
Step 5. Create books.pug template.
extends layout

block content
  .page-header
    h3 All Books

  ul
    for book in books
      li= book.name
That's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:
app.get('/books',(req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
});
Sure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in app.js it becomes a little challenging to navigate the file.
I mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could
work with your teammates without running into MERGE CONFLICTS. Imagine you have four developers
working on a single app.js, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.
If you are the only developer, then it's okay. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes difficult to maintain everything in a single file.
That's all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use.
Most of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work:
Mongoose for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over websockets,
sending emails via Nodemailer, form validation using express-validator library,
parsing websites using Cheerio, etc.

How do I use Socket.io with Hackathon Starter?
Dan Stroot submitted an excellent pull request that adds a real-time dashboard with socket.io.
And as  much as I'd like to add it to the project, I think it violates one of the main
principles of the Hackathon Starter:

When I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use.
I also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of
hackathon web apps, without being too specific.

When I need to use socket.io, I really need it, but most of the time - I don't. But more importantly, websockets support is still experimental on most hosting providers. As of October 2013,
Heroku supports websockets, but not until you opt-in by running this command:
heroku labs:enable websockets -a myapp
And what if you are deploying to OpenShift? They do support websockets, but it is currently in a
preview state. So, for OpenShift you would need to change the socket.io connect URI to the following:
const socket = io.connect('http://yoursite-namespace.rhcloud.com:8000');
Wait, why is it on port 8000? Who knows, and if I didn't run across this blog post
I wouldn't even know I had to use port 8000.
I am really glad that Heroku and OpenShift at least
have a websockets support, because many other PaaS providers still do not support it.
Due to the aforementioned issues with websockets, I cannot include socket.io as part of the Hackathon Starter. For now...
If you need to use socket.io in your app, please continue reading.
First, you need to install socket.io:
npm install socket.io --save
Replace const app = express(); with the following code:
const app = express();
const server = require('http').Server(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(server);
I like to have the following code organization in app.js (from top to bottom): module dependencies,
import controllers, import configs, connect to database, express configuration, routes,
start the server, socket.io stuff. That way I always know where to look for things.
Add the following code at the end of app.js:
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.emit('greet', { hello: 'Hey there browser!' });
  socket.on('respond', (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Socket disconnected');
  });
});
One last thing left to change:
app.listen(app.get('port'), () => {
to
server.listen(app.get('port'), () => {
At this point, we are done with the back-end.
You now have a choice - to include your JavaScript code in Pug templates or have all your client-side
JavaScript in a separate file - in main.js. I admit, when I first started with Node.js and JavaScript in general,
I placed all JavaScript code inside templates because I have access to template variables passed in from Express
right then and there. It's the easiest thing you can do, but also the least efficient and harder to maintain. Since then I
almost never include inline JavaScript inside templates anymore.
But it's also understandable if you want to take the easier road.
Most of the time you don't even care about performance during hackathons, you just
want to ""get shit done"" before the time runs out.
Well, either way, use whichever approach makes more sense to you. At the end of the day,
it's what you build that matters, not how you build it.
If you want to stick all your JavaScript inside templates, then in layout.pug -
your main template file, add this to head block.
script(src='/socket.io/socket.io.js')
script.
    let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
    socket.on('greet', function (data) {
      console.log(data);
      socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hey there, server!' });
    });
Note: Notice the path of the socket.io.js, you don't actually
have to have socket.io.js file anywhere in your project; it will be generated
automatically at runtime.
If you want to have JavaScript code separate from templates, move that inline
script code into main.js, inside the $(document).ready() function:
$(document).ready(function() {

  // Place JavaScript code here...
  let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
  socket.on('greet', function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hello to you too, Mr.Server!' });
  });

});
And we are done!
Cheatsheets
 ES6 Cheatsheet
Declarations
Declares a read-only named constant.
const name = 'yourName';
Declares a block scope local variable.
let index = 0;
Template Strings
Using the `${}` syntax, strings can embed expressions.
const name = 'Oggy';
const age = 3;

console.log(`My cat is named ${name} and is ${age} years old.`);
Modules
To import functions, objects or primitives exported from an external module. These are the most common types of importing.
const name = require('module-name');
const { foo, bar } = require('module-name');
To export functions, objects or primitives from a given file or module.
module.exports = { myFunction };
module.exports.name = 'yourName';
module.exports = myFunctionOrClass;
Spread Operator
The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.
myFunction(...iterableObject);
<ChildComponent {...this.props} />
Promises
A Promise is used in asynchronous computations to represent an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.
var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { });
The catch() method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only.
p.catch(function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });
The then() method returns a Promise. It takes two arguments: callback for the success & failure cases.
p.then(function(value) { /* handle fulfillment */ }, function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });
The Promise.all(iterable) method returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved or rejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.
Promise.all([p1, p2, p3]).then(function(values) { console.log(values) });
Arrow Functions
Arrow function expression. Shorter syntax & lexically binds the this value. Arrow functions are anonymous.
singleParam => { statements }
() => { statements }
(param1, param2) => expression
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squares = arr.map(x => x * x);
Classes
The class declaration creates a new class using prototype-based inheritance.
class Person {
  constructor(name, age, gender) {
    this.name   = name;
    this.age    = age;
    this.gender = gender;
  }

  incrementAge() {
    this.age++;
  }
}

Get the total count of a field from all documents:
Let's suppose that each user has a votes field and you would like to count
the total number of votes in your database across all users. One very
inefficient way would be to loop through each document and manually accumulate
the count. Or you could use MongoDB Aggregation Framework instead:
User.aggregate({ $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: '$votes' } } }, (err, votesCount)  => {
  console.log(votesCount.total);
});

Docker
You will need docker and docker-compose installed to build the application.


Docker installation


Common problems setting up docker


After installing docker, start the application with the following commands :
# To build the project for the first time or when you add dependencies
docker-compose build web

# To start the application (or to restart after making changes to the source code)
docker-compose up web


To view the app, find your docker IP address + port 8080 ( this will typically be http://localhost:8080/ ).  To use a port other than 8080, you would need to modify the port in app.js, Dockerfile, and docker-compose.yml.
Deployment
Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top picks. From my experience, the easiest way to get started is with Heroku. It will automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, has zero-downtime deployments and supports custom domains on free accounts. Additionally, you can
create an account with MongoDB Atlas and then pick one of the 4 providers below.
Again, there are plenty of other choices, and you are not limited to just the ones
listed below.
1-Step Deployment with Heroku


Download and install Heroku Toolbelt
In a terminal, run heroku login and enter your Heroku credentials
From your app directory run heroku create
Run heroku addons:create mongolab.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the MONGODB_URI environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
Lastly, do git push heroku master.  Done!

Note: To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.

Hosted MongoDB Atlas


Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
Click the green Get started free button
Fill in your information then hit Get started free
You will be redirected to Create New Cluster page.
Select a Cloud Provider and Region (such as AWS and a free tier region)
Select cluster Tier to Free Shared Clusters
Give Cluster a name (default: Cluster0)
Click on green ⚡️Create Cluster button
Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user. To create a new MongoDB user, from the Clusters view, select the Security tab
Under the MongoDB Users tab, click on +Add New User
Fill in a username and password and give it either Atlas Admin User Privilege
Next, you will need to create an IP address whitelist and obtain the connection URI.  In the Clusters view, under the cluster details (i.e. SANDBOX - Cluster0), click on the CONNECT button.
Under section (1) Check the IP Whitelist, click on ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE. The form will add a field with 0.0.0.0/0.  Click SAVE to save the 0.0.0.0/0 whitelist.
Under section (2) Choose a connection method, click on Connect Your Application
In the new screen, select Node.js as Driver and version 2.2.12 or later. WARNING: Do not pick 3.0 or later since connect-mongo can't handle mongodb+srv:// connection strings.
Finally, copy the URI connection string and replace the URI in MONGODB_URI of .env.example with this URI string.  Make sure to replace the  with the db User password that you created under the Security tab.
Note that after some of the steps in the Atlas UI, you may see a banner stating We are deploying your changes.  You will need to wait for the deployment to finish before using the DB in your application.

Note: As an alternative to MongoDB Atlas, there is also Compose.

OpenShift

**NOTE** *These instructions might be out of date due to changes in OpenShift. Heroku is currently a good free alternative.  If you the new process, please feel free to help us update this page*

First, install this Ruby gem: sudo gem install rhc 💎
Run rhc login and enter your OpenShift credentials
From your app directory run rhc app create MyApp nodejs-0.10
Note: MyApp is the name of your app (no spaces)
Once that is done, you will be provided with URL, SSH and Git Remote links
Visit provided URL, and you should see the Welcome to your Node.js application on OpenShift page
Copy and paste Git Remote into git remote add openshift YOUR_GIT_REMOTE
Before you push your app, you need to do a few modifications to your code

Add these two lines to app.js, just place them anywhere before app.listen():
var IP_ADDRESS = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || '127.0.0.1';
var PORT = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || 8080;
Then change app.listen() to:
app.listen(PORT, IP_ADDRESS,() => {
  console.log(`Express server listening on port ${PORT} in ${app.settings.env} mode`);
});
Add this to package.json, after name and version. This is necessary because, by default, OpenShift looks for server.js file. And by specifying supervisor app.js it will automatically restart the server when node.js process crashes.
""main"": ""app.js"",
""scripts"": {
  ""start"": ""supervisor app.js""
},

Finally, you can now push your code to OpenShift by running git push -f openshift master
Note: The first time you run this command, you have to pass -f (force) flag because OpenShift creates a dummy server with the welcome page when you create a new Node.js app. Passing -f flag will override everything with your Hackathon Starter project repository. Do not run git pull as it will create unnecessary merge conflicts.
And you are done!


Azure

**NOTE** *Beyond the initial 12 month trial of Azure, the platform does not seem to offer a free tier for hosting NodeJS apps.  If you are looking for a free tier service to host your app, Heroku might be a better choice at this point*

Login to Windows Azure Management Portal
Click the + NEW button on the bottom left of the portal
Click COMPUTE, then WEB APP, then QUICK CREATE
Enter a name for URL and select the datacenter REGION for your web site
Click on CREATE WEB APP button
Once the web site status changes to Running, click on the name of the web site to access the Dashboard
At the bottom right of the Quickstart page, select Set up a deployment from source control
Select Local Git repository from the list, and then click the arrow
To enable Git publishing, Azure will ask you to create a user name and password
Once the Git repository is ready, you will be presented with a GIT URL
Inside your Hackathon Starter directory, run git remote add azure [Azure Git URL]
To push your changes run git push azure master
Note: You will be prompted for the password you created earlier
On Deployments tab of your Windows Azure Web App, you will see the deployment history


IBM Bluemix Cloud Platform
NOTE At this point it appears that Bluemix's free tier to host NodeJS apps is limited to 30 days.  If you are looking for a free tier service to host your app, Heroku might be a better choice at this point


Create a Bluemix Account
Sign up for Bluemix, or use an existing account.


Download and install the Cloud Foundry CLI to push your applications to Bluemix.


Create a manifest.yml file in the root of your application.


applications:
- name:      <your-app-name>
  host:      <your-app-host>
  memory:    128M
  services:
  - myMongo-db-name

The host you use will determinate your application URL initially, e.g. <host>.mybluemix.net.
The service name 'myMongo-db-name' is a declaration of your MongoDB service.  If you are using other services like Watson for example, then you would declare them the same way.

Connect and login to Bluemix via the Cloud-foundry CLI

$ cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net


Create a MongoDB service

$ cf create-service mongodb 100 [your-service-name]

Note: this is a free and experiment verion of MongoDB instance.
Use the MongoDB by Compose instance for production applications:
$ cf create-service compose-for-mongodb Standard [your-service-name]'



Push the application
$ cf push

$ cf env <your-app-name >
(To view the *environment variables* created for your application)




Done, now go to the staging domain(<host>.mybluemix.net.) and see your app running.

Introduction
Suggestion are more than welcome, not only for feature requests but also for coding style improvements.
Let's make this a great library to make people's lives easier!
Compatibility
fullPage.js is fully functional on all modern browsers, as well as some old ones such as Internet Explorer 9, Opera 12, etc.
It works with browsers with CSS3 support and with the ones which don't have it, making it ideal for old browsers compatibility.
It also provides touch support for mobile phones, tablets and touch screen computers.
Special thanks to Browserstack for supporting fullpage.js.
License
Commercial license
If you want to use fullPage to develop non open sourced sites, themes, projects, and applications, the Commercial license is the appropriate license. With this option, your source code is kept proprietary. Which means, you won't have to change your whole application source code to an open source license. [Purchase a Fullpage Commercial License]
Open source license
If you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the GNU GPL license v3, you may use fullPage under the terms of the GPLv3.
The credit comments in the JavaScript and CSS files should be kept intact (even after combination or minification)
Read more about fullPage's license.
Usage
As you can see in the example files, you will need to include:

The JavaScript file fullpage.js (or its minified version fullpage.min.js)
The css file fullpage.css

Optionally, when using css3:false, you can add the easings file in case you want to use other easing effects apart from the one included in the library (easeInOutCubic).
Install using bower or npm
Optionally, you can install fullPage.js with bower or npm if you prefer:
Terminal:
// With bower
bower install fullpage.js

// With npm
npm install fullpage.js
Including files:
<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""fullpage.css"" />

<!-- This following line is optional. Only necessary if you use the option css3:false and you want to use other easing effects rather than ""easeInOutCubic"". -->
<script src=""vendors/easings.min.js""></script>


<!-- This following line is only necessary in the case of using the option `scrollOverflow:true` -->
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""vendors/scrolloverflow.min.js""></script>

<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""fullpage.js""></script>
Using Webpack, Browserify or Require.js? Check how to use fullPage.js with module loaders.
Optional use of CDN
If you prefer to use a CDN to load the needed files, fullPage.js is in CDNJS:
https://cdnjs.com/libraries/fullPage.js
Required HTML structure
Start your HTML document with the compulsory HTML DOCTYPE declaration on the 1st line of your HTML code. You might have troubles with sections heights otherwise. The examples provided use HTML 5 doctype <!DOCTYPE html>.
Each section will be defined with an element containing the section class.
The active section by default will be the first section, which is taken as the home page.
Sections should be placed inside a wrapper (<div id=""fullpage""> in this case). The wrapper can not be the body element.
<div id=""fullpage"">
	<div class=""section"">Some section</div>
	<div class=""section"">Some section</div>
	<div class=""section"">Some section</div>
	<div class=""section"">Some section</div>
</div>
If you want to define a different starting point rather than the first section or the first slide of a section, just add the class active to the section and slide you want to load first.
<div class=""section active"">Some section</div>
In order to create a landscape slider within a section, each slide will be defined by default with an element containing the slide class:
<div class=""section"">
	<div class=""slide""> Slide 1 </div>
	<div class=""slide""> Slide 2 </div>
	<div class=""slide""> Slide 3 </div>
	<div class=""slide""> Slide 4 </div>
</div>
You can see a fully working example of the HTML structure in the simple.html file.
Initialization
Initialization with Vanilla Javascript
All you need to do is call fullPage.js before the closing </body> tag.
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	//options here
	autoScrolling:true,
	scrollHorizontally: true
});

//methods
fullpage_api.setAllowScrolling(false);
Initialization with jQuery
You can use fullpage.js as a jQuery plugin if you want too!
$(document).ready(function() {
	$('#fullpage').fullpage({
		//options here
		autoScrolling:true,
		scrollHorizontally: true
	});

	//methods
	$.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false);
});
Functions and methods can still be called in the jQuery way, as in fullPage.js v2.X.
Vanilla JS example with all options
A more complex initialization with all options set could look like this:
var myFullpage = new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	//Navigation
	menu: '#menu',
	lockAnchors: false,
	anchors:['firstPage', 'secondPage'],
	navigation: false,
	navigationPosition: 'right',
	navigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide'],
	showActiveTooltip: false,
	slidesNavigation: false,
	slidesNavPosition: 'bottom',

	//Scrolling
	css3: true,

Creating links to sections or slides
If you are using fullPage.js with anchor links for the sections (using the anchors option or the attribute data-anchor in each section), then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section.
This would be an example of a link with an anchor: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#secondPage/2 (which is the URL you will see once you access to that section/slide manually)
Notice the last part of the URL ends in #secondPage/2.
Having the following initialization:
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	anchors:['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage']
});
The anchor at the end of the URL #secondPage/2 defines the section and slide of destination respectively. In the previous URL, the section of destination will be the one defined with the anchor secondPage and the slide will be the 2nd slide, as we are using the index 2 for it. (the fist slide of a section has index 0, as technically it is a section).
We could have used a custom anchor for the slide instead of its index if we would have used the attribute data-anchor on the HTML markup like so:
<div class=""section"">
	<div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide1""> Slide 1 </div>
	<div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide2""> Slide 2 </div>
	<div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide3""> Slide 3 </div>
	<div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide4""> Slide 4 </div>
</div>
In this last case, the URL we would use would be #secondPage/slide3, which is the equivalent to our previous #secondPage/2.
Note that section anchors can also be defined in the same way, by using the data-anchor attribute, if no anchors array is provided.
Be careful! data-anchor tags can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE).
Creating smaller or bigger sections
Demo fullPage.js provides a way to remove the full height restriction from its sections and slides. It is possible to create sections which height is smaller or bigger than the viewport. This is ideal for footers.
It is important to realise that it doesn't make sense to have all of your sections using this feature. If there is more than one section in the initial load of the site, fullPage.js won't scroll at all to see the next one as it will be already in the viewport.
To create smaller sections just use the class fp-auto-height in the section you want to apply it. It will then take the height defined by your section/slide content.
<div class=""section"">Whole viewport</div>
<div class=""section fp-auto-height"">Auto height</div>
Responsive auto height sections
Demo A responsive auto height can be applied by using the class fp-auto-height-responsive. This way sections will be fullscreen until the responsive mode gets fired. Then they'll take the size required by their content, which could be bigger or smaller than the viewport.
State classes added by fullpage.js
Fullpage.js adds multiple classes in different elements to keep a record of the status of the site:

active is added the current visible section and slide.
active is added to the current menu element (if using the menu option).
A class of the form fp-viewing-SECTION-SLIDE is added to the body element of the site. (eg: fp-viewing-secondPage-0) The SECTION and SLIDE parts will be the anchors (or indexes if no anchor is provided) of the current section and slide.
fp-responsive is added to the body element when the entering in the responsive mode
fp-enabled is added to the html element when fullpage.js is enabled. (and removed when destroyed).
fp-destroyed is added to the fullpage.js container when fullPage.js is destroyed.

Lazy Loading
Demo fullPage.js provides a way to lazy load images, videos and audio elements so they won't slow down the loading of your site or unnecessarily waste data transfer.
When using lazy loading, all these elements will only get loaded when entering in the viewport.
To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your src attribute to data-src as shown below:
<img data-src=""image.png"">
<video>
	<source data-src=""video.webm"" type=""video/webm"" />
	<source data-src=""video.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"" />
</video>
If you already use another lazy load solution which uses data-src as well, you can disable the fullPage.js lazy loading by setting the option lazyLoading: false.
Auto play/pause embedded media
Note: the autoplay feature might not work on some mobile devices depending on the OS and browser (i.e. Safari on iOS version < 10.0).
Play on section/slide load:
Using the attribute autoplay for videos or audio, or the param autoplay=1 for youtube iframes will result in the media element playing on page load.
In order to play it on section/slide load use instead the attribute data-autoplay. For example:
<audio data-autoplay>
	<source src=""http://metakoncept.hr/horse.ogg"" type=""audio/ogg"">
</audio>
Pause on leave
Embedded HTML5 <video> / <audio>  and Youtube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a section or slide. This can be disabled by using the attribute data-keepplaying. For example:
<audio data-keepplaying>
	<source src=""http://metakoncept.hr/horse.ogg"" type=""audio/ogg"">
</audio>
Use extensions
fullpage.js provides a set of extensions you can use to enhance its default features. All of them are listed as fullpage.js options.
Extensions requires you to use the minified file fullpage.extensions.min.js that is inside the dist folder instead of the usual fullPage.js file (fullpage.js or fullpage.min.js).
Once you adquire the extension file, you will need to add it before fullPage. For example, if I want to use the Continuous Horizontal extension, I would have include the extension file and then the extensions version of the fullPage file.
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""fullpage.continuousHorizontal.min.js""></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""fullpage/fullpage.extensions.min.js""></script>
An activation key and a license key will be required for each extension. See more details about it here.
Then you will be able to use and configure them as explained in options.
Options

licenseKey: (default null). This option is compulsory. If you use fullPage in a non open source project, then you should use the license key provided on the purchase of the fullPage Commercial License. If your project is open source, contact me with a link to its repository and I'll provide you a license key. Please read more about licenses here and on the website. For example:

new fullpage({
    licenseKey: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'
});


v2compatible: (default false). Determines whether to make it 100% compatible with any code written for version 2, ignoring new features or api changes of version 3. State classes, callbacks signature etc. will work exactly in the same way as it did on verion 2. Note that this option will be removed at some point in the future..


controlArrows: (default true) Determines whether to use control arrows for the slides to move right or left.


verticalCentered: (default true) Vertically centering of the content within sections. When set to true, your content will be wrapped by the library. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterRender callback.


scrollingSpeed: (default 700) Speed in milliseconds for the scrolling transitions.


sectionsColor: (default none) Define the CSS background-color property for each section.
Example:


new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	sectionsColor: ['#f2f2f2', '#4BBFC3', '#7BAABE', 'whitesmoke', '#000'],
});


anchors: (default []) Defines the anchor links (#example) to be shown on the URL for each section. Anchors value should be unique. The position of the anchors in the array will define to which sections the anchor is applied. (second position for second section and so on). Using anchors forward and backward navigation will also be possible through the browser. This option also allows users to bookmark a specific section or slide. Be careful! anchors can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE).
Now anchors can be defined directly in the HTML structure by using the attribute data-anchor as explained here.


lockAnchors: (default false) Determines whether anchors in the URL will have any effect at all in the library. You can still using anchors internally for your own functions and callbacks, but they won't have any effect in the scrolling of the site. Useful if you want to combine fullPage.js with other plugins using anchor in the URL.


Important It is helpful to understand that the values in the anchors option array correlate directly to the element with the class of .section by it's position in the markup.


easing: (default easeInOutCubic) Defines the transition effect to use for the vertical and horizontal scrolling.
It requires the file vendors/easings.min.js or jQuery UI for using some of its transitions. Other libraries could be used instead.


easingcss3: (default ease) Defines the transition effect to use in case of using css3:true. You can use the pre-defined ones (such as linear, ease-out...) or create your own ones using the cubic-bezier function. You might want to use Matthew Lein CSS Easing Animation Tool for it.


loopTop: (default false) Defines whether scrolling up in the first section should scroll to the last one or not.


loopBottom: (default false) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section should scroll to the first one or not.


loopHorizontal: (default true) Defines whether horizontal sliders will loop after reaching the last or previous slide or not.


css3: (default true). Defines whether to use JavaScript or CSS3 transforms to scroll within sections and slides. Useful to speed up the movement in tablet and mobile devices with browsers supporting CSS3. If this option is set to true and the browser doesn't support CSS3, a fallback will be used instead.


autoScrolling: (default true) Defines whether to use the ""automatic"" scrolling or the ""normal"" one. It also has affects the way the sections fit in the browser/device window in tablets and mobile phones.


fitToSection: (default true) Determines whether or not to fit sections to the viewport or not. When set to true the current active section will always fill the whole viewport. Otherwise the user will be free to stop in the middle of a section.


fitToSectionDelay: (default 1000). If fitToSection is set to true, this delays
the fitting by the configured milliseconds.


scrollBar: (default false) Determines whether to use scrollbar for the site or not. In case of using scroll bar, the autoScrolling functionality will still work as expected. The user will also be free to scroll the site with the scroll bar and fullPage.js will fit the section in the screen when scrolling finishes.


paddingTop: (default 0) Defines the top padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingTop: '10px', paddingTop: '10em'...) Useful in case of using a fixed header.


paddingBottom: (default 0) Defines the bottom padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingBottom: '10px', paddingBottom: '10em'...). Useful in case of using a fixed footer.


fixedElements: (default null) Defines which elements will be taken off the scrolling structure of the plugin which is necessary when using the css3 option to keep them fixed. It requires a string with the Javascript selectors for those elements. (For example: fixedElements: '#element1, .element2')


normalScrollElements: (default null) If you want to avoid the auto scroll when scrolling over some elements, this is the option you need to use. (useful for maps, scrolling divs etc.) It requires a string with the Javascript selectors for those elements. (For example: normalScrollElements: '#element1, .element2'). This option should not be applied to any section/slide element itself.


normalScrollElementTouchThreshold : (default 5) Defines the threshold for the number of hops up the html node tree Fullpage will test to see if normalScrollElements is a match to allow scrolling functionality on divs on a touch device. (For example: normalScrollElementTouchThreshold: 3)


bigSectionsDestination: (default null) Defines how to scroll to a section which size is bigger than the viewport. By default fullPage.js scrolls to the top if you come from a section above the destination one and to the bottom if you come from a section below the destination one. Possible values are top, bottom, null.


keyboardScrolling: (default true) Defines if the content can be navigated using the keyboard.


touchSensitivity: (default 5) Defines a percentage of the browsers window width/height, and how far a swipe must measure for navigating to the next section / slide


continuousVertical: (default false) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section or should scroll down to the first one and if scrolling up in the first section should scroll up to the last one. Not compatible with loopTop, loopBottom or any scroll bar present in the site (scrollBar:true or autoScrolling:false).


continuousHorizontal: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether sliding right in the last slide should slide right to the first one or not, and if scrolling left in the first slide should slide left to the last one or not. Not compatible with loopHorizontal. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.


scrollHorizontally: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether to slide horizontally within sliders by using the mouse wheel or trackpad. It can only be used when using: autoScrolling:true. Ideal for story telling. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.


interlockedSlides: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Determines whether moving one horizontal slider will force the sliding of sliders in other section in the same direction. Possible values are true, false or an array with the interlocked sections. For example [1,3,5] starting by 1. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.


dragAndMove: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Enables or disables the dragging and flicking of sections and slides by using mouse or fingers. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1. Possible values are:

true: enables the feature.
false: disables the feature.
vertical: enables the feature only vertically.
horizontal: enables the feature only horizontally.
fingersonly: enables the feature for touch devices only.
mouseonly: enables the feature for desktop devices only (mouse and trackpad).



offsetSections: (default false)Extension of fullpage.js. Provides a way to use non full screen sections based on percentage. Ideal to show visitors there's more content in the site by showing part of the next or previous section. Requires fullPage.js >= 3.0.1.
To define the percentage of each section the attribute data-percentage must be used. The centering of the section in the viewport can be determined by using a boolean value in the attribute data-centered (default to true if not specified). For example:


    <div class=""section"" data-percentage=""80"" data-centered=""true"">


resetSliders: (default false). Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether or not to reset every slider after leaving its section. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.


fadingEffect: (default false). Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether to use a fading effect or not instead of the default scrolling one. Possible values are true, false, sections, slides. It can therefore be applied just vertically or horizontally, or to both at the time. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.


animateAnchor: (default true) Defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor (#) will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given section.


recordHistory: (default true) Defines whether to push the state of the site to the browser's history. When set to true each section/slide of the site will act as a new page and the back and forward buttons of the browser will scroll the sections/slides to reach the previous or next state of the site. When set to false, the URL will keep changing but will have no effect on the browser's history. This option is automatically turned off when using autoScrolling:false.


menu: (default false) A selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the sections. This way the scrolling of the sections will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the class active.
This won't generate a menu but will just add the active class to the element in the given menu with the corresponding anchor links.
In order to link the elements of the menu with the sections, an HTML 5 data-tag (data-menuanchor) will be needed to use with the same anchor links as used within the sections. Example:


<ul id=""myMenu"">
	<li data-menuanchor=""firstPage"" class=""active""><a href=""#firstPage"">First section</a></li>
	<li data-menuanchor=""secondPage""><a href=""#secondPage"">Second section</a></li>
	<li data-menuanchor=""thirdPage""><a href=""#thirdPage"">Third section</a></li>
	<li data-menuanchor=""fourthPage""><a href=""#fourthPage"">Fourth section</a></li>
</ul>
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	anchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage', 'fourthPage', 'lastPage'],
	menu: '#myMenu'
});
Note: the menu element should be placed outside the fullpage wrapper in order to avoid problem when using css3:true. Otherwise it will be appended to the body by the plugin itself.


navigation: (default false) If set to true, it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles.


navigationPosition: (default none) It can be set to left or right and defines which position the navigation bar will be shown (if using one).


navigationTooltips: (default []) Defines the tooltips to show for the navigation circles in case they are being used. Example: navigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide']. You can also define them by using the attribute data-tooltip in each section if you prefer.


showActiveTooltip: (default false) Shows a persistent tooltip for the actively viewed section in the vertical navigation.


slidesNavigation: (default false) If set to true it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles for each landscape slider on the site.


slidesNavPosition: (default bottom) Defines the position for the landscape navigation bar for sliders. Admits top and bottom as values. You may want to modify the CSS styles to determine the distance from the top or bottom as well as any other style such as color.


scrollOverflow: (default false) defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section/slide in case its content is bigger than the height of it. When set to true, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterRender callback.
In case of setting it to true, it requires the vendor library scrolloverflow.min.js. This file has to be loaded before the fullPage.js plugin, but after jQuery ( in case of using it).
For example:


<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""vendors/scrolloverflow.min.js""></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""fullpage.js""></script>
In order to prevent fullpage.js from creating the scrollbar in certain sections or slides use the class fp-noscroll. For example: <div class=""section fp-noscroll"">
You can also prevent scrolloverflow from getting applied on responsive mode when using fp-auto-height-responsive in the section element.


scrollOverflowReset: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. When set to true it scrolls up the content of the section/slide with scroll bar when leaving to another vertical section. This way the section/slide will always show the start of its content even when scrolling from a section under it.


scrollOverflowOptions: when using scrollOverflow:true fullpage.js will make use of a forked and modified version of iScroll.js library. You can customize the scrolling behaviour by providing fullpage.js with the iScroll.js options you want to use. Check its documentation for more info.


sectionSelector: (default .section) Defines the Javascript selector used for the plugin sections. It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.


slideSelector: (default .slide)  Defines the Javascript selector used for the plugin slides.  It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.


responsiveWidth: (default 0)  A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined width in pixels. A class fp-responsive is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for their own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's width is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.


responsiveHeight: (default 0)  A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined height in pixels. A class fp-responsive is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for their own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's height is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.


responsiveSlides: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. When set to true slides will be turned into vertical sections when responsive mode is fired. (by using the responsiveWidth or responsiveHeight options detailed above). Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.


parallax: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether or not to use the parallax backgrounds effects on sections / slides. Read more about how to apply the parallax option.


parallaxOptions: (default: { type: 'reveal', percentage: 62, property: 'translate'}). Allows to configure the parameters for the parallax backgrounds effect when using the option parallax:true. Read more about how to apply the parallax option.


cards: (default false) Extension of fullpage.js. Defines whether or not to use the cards effect on sections/slides. Read more about how to apply the cards option.


cardsOptions: (default: { perspective: 100, fadeContent: true, fadeBackground: true}). Allows you to configure the parameters for the cards effect when using the option cards:true. Read more about how to apply the cards option.


lazyLoading: (default true) Lazy loading is active by default which means it will lazy load any media element containing the attribute data-src as detailed in the Lazy Loading docs . If you want to use any other lazy loading library you can disable this fullpage.js feature.


Methods
You can see them in action here

/*Scrolling to the section with the anchor link `firstSlide` and to the 2nd Slide */
fullpage_api.moveTo('firstSlide', 2);

//Scrolling to the 3rd section in the site
fullpage_api.moveTo(3, 0);

//Which is the same as
fullpage_api.moveTo(3);

silentMoveTo(section, slide)
Demo
Exactly the same as moveTo but in this case it performs the scroll without animation. A direct jump to the destination.
/*Scrolling to the section with the anchor link `firstSlide` and to the 2nd Slide */
fullpage_api.silentMoveTo('firstSlide', 2);

moveSlideRight()
Demo
Scrolls the horizontal slider of the current section to the next slide:
fullpage_api.moveSlideRight();

moveSlideLeft()
Demo
Scrolls the horizontal slider of the current section to the previous slide:
fullpage_api.moveSlideLeft();

setAutoScrolling(boolean)
Demo Sets the scrolling configuration in real time.
Defines the way the page scrolling behaves. If it is set to true, it will use the ""automatic"" scrolling, otherwise, it will use the ""manual"" or ""normal"" scrolling of the site.
fullpage_api.setAutoScrolling(false);

setFitToSection(boolean)
Demo
Sets the value for the option fitToSection determining whether to fit the section in the screen or not.
fullpage_api.setFitToSection(false);

setAllowScrolling(boolean, [directions])
Demo Adds or remove the possibility of scrolling through sections/slides by using the mouse wheel/trackpad or touch gestures (which is active by default). Note this won't disable the keyboard scrolling. You
would need to use setKeyboardScrolling for it.

directions: (optional parameter) Admitted values: all, up, down, left, right or a combination of them separated by commas like down, right. It defines the direction for which the scrolling will be enabled or disabled.

//disabling scrolling
fullpage_api.setAllowScrolling(false);

Demo Destroys the plugin events and optionally its HTML markup and styles.
Ideal to use when using AJAX to load content.

type: (optional parameter) can be empty or all. If all is passed, the HTML markup and styles used by fullpage.js will be removed. This way the original HTML markup, the one used before any plugin modification is made, will be maintained.

//destroying all Javascript events created by fullPage.js (scrolls, hashchange in the URL...)
fullpage_api.destroy();

//destroying all Javascript events and any modification done by fullPage.js over your original HTML markup.
fullpage_api.destroy('all');

reBuild()
Updates the DOM structure to fit the new window size or its contents.
Ideal to use in combination with AJAX calls or external changes in the DOM structure of the site, specially when using scrollOverflow:true.
fullpage_api.reBuild();

setResponsive(boolean)
Demo Sets the responsive mode of the page. When set to true the autoScrolling will be turned off and the result will be exactly the same one as when the responsiveWidth or responsiveHeight options  get fired.
fullpage_api.setResponsive(true);

responsiveSlides.toSections()
Extension of fullpage.js. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.
Turns horizontal slides into vertical sections.
fullpage_api.responsiveSlides.toSections();

responsiveSlides.toSlides()
Extension of fullpage.js. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.
Turns back the original slides (now converted into vertical sections) into horizontal slides again.
fullpage_api.responsiveSlides.toSlides();
Callbacks
Demo You can see them in action here.
Some callbacks, such as onLeave will contain Object type of parameters containing the following properties:

anchor: (String) item's anchor.
index: (Number) item's index.
item: (DOM element) item element.
isFirst: (Boolean) determines if the item is the first child.
isLast: (Boolean) determines if the item is the last child.

afterLoad (origin, destination, direction)
Callback fired once the sections have been loaded, after the scrolling has ended.
Parameters:

origin: (Object) section of origin.
destination: (Object) destination section.
direction: (String) it will take the values up or down depending on the scrolling direction.

Example:
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	anchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage', 'fourthPage', 'lastPage'],

	afterLoad: function(origin, destination, direction){
		var loadedSection = this;

		//using index
		if(origin.index == 2){
			alert(""Section 3 ended loading"");
		}

		//using anchorLink
		if(origin.anchor == 'secondSlide'){
			alert(""Section 2 ended loading"");
		}
	}
});

onLeave (origin, destination, direction)
This callback is fired once the user leaves a section, in the transition to the new section.
Returning false will cancel the move before it takes place.
Parameters:

origin:  (Object) section of origin.
destination: (Object) destination section.
direction: (String) it will take the values up or down depending on the scrolling direction.

Example:
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	onLeave: function(origin, destination, direction){
		var leavingSection = this;

		//after leaving section 2
		if(origin.index == 1 && direction =='down'){
			alert(""Going to section 3!"");
		}

		else if(origin.index == 1 && direction == 'up'){
			alert(""Going to section 1!"");
		}
	}
});
Cancelling the scroll before it takes place
You can cancel the scroll by returning false on the onLeave callback:
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	onLeave: function(origin, destination, direction){
		//it won't scroll if the destination is the 3rd section
		if(destination.index == 2){
			return false;
		}
	}
});

afterRender()
This callback is fired just after the structure of the page is generated. This is the callback you want to use to initialize other plugins or fire any code which requires the document to be ready (as this plugin modifies the DOM to create the resulting structure). See FAQs for more info.
Example:
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	afterRender: function(){
		var pluginContainer = this;
		alert(""The resulting DOM structure is ready"");
	}
});

afterResize(width, height)
This callback is fired after resizing the browser's window. Just after the sections are resized.
Parameters:

width:  (Number) window's width.
height: (Number) window's height.

Example:
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	afterResize: function(width, height){
		var fullpageContainer = this;
		alert(""The sections have finished resizing"");
	}
});

afterResponsive(isResponsive)
This callback is fired after fullpage.js changes from normal to responsive mode or from responsive mode to normal mode.
Parameters:

isResponsive: (Boolean) determines if it enters into responsive mode (true) or goes back to normal mode (false).

Example:
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	afterResponsive: function(isResponsive){
		alert(""Is responsive: "" + isResponsive);
	}
});

afterSlideLoad (section, origin, destination, direction)
Callback fired once the slide of a section have been loaded, after the scrolling has ended.
Parameters:

section: (Object) active vertical section.
origin: (Object) horizontal slide of origin.
destination: (Object) destination horizontal slide.
direction: (String) right or left depending on the scrolling direction.

Example:
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	anchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage', 'fourthPage', 'lastPage'],

	afterSlideLoad: function( section, origin, destination, direction){
		var loadedSlide = this;

		//first slide of the second section
		if(section.anchor == 'secondPage' && destination.index == 1){
			alert(""First slide loaded"");
		}

		//second slide of the second section (supposing #secondSlide is the
		//anchor for the second slide)
		if(section.index == 1 && destination.anchor == 'secondSlide'){
			alert(""Second slide loaded"");
		}
	}
});

onSlideLeave (section, origin, destination, direction)
This callback is fired once the user leaves an slide to go to another, in the transition to the new slide.
Returning false will cancel the move before it takes place.
Parameters:

section: (Object) active vertical section.
origin: (Object) horizontal slide of origin.
destination: (Object) destination horizontal slide.
direction: (String) right or left depending on the scrolling direction.

Example:
new fullpage('#fullpage', {
	onSlideLeave: function( section, origin, destination, direction){
		var leavingSlide = this;

		//leaving the first slide of the 2nd Section to the right
		if(section.index == 1 && origin.index == 0 && direction == 'right'){
			alert(""Leaving the fist slide!!"");
		}

		//leaving the 3rd slide of the 2nd Section to the left
		if(section.index == 1 && origin.index == 2 && direction == 'left'){
			alert(""Going to slide 2! "");
		}
	}
});
Cancelling a move before it takes place
You can cancel a move by returning false on the onSlideLeave callback. Same as when canceling a movement with onLeave.

Certbot is part of EFF’s effort to encrypt the entire Internet. Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identity of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?). Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs). Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from Let’s Encrypt—an open certificate authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others—and deploys it to a web server.
Anyone who has gone through the trouble of setting up a secure website knows what a hassle getting and maintaining a certificate is. Certbot and Let’s Encrypt can automate away the pain and let you turn on and manage HTTPS with simple commands. Using Certbot and Let's Encrypt is free, so there’s no need to arrange payment.
How you use Certbot depends on the configuration of your web server. The best way to get started is to use our interactive guide. It generates instructions based on your configuration settings. In most cases, you’ll need root or administrator access to your web server to run Certbot.
Certbot is meant to be run directly on your web server, not on your personal computer. If you’re using a hosted service and don’t have direct access to your web server, you might not be able to use Certbot. Check with your hosting provider for documentation about uploading certificates or using certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt.
Certbot is a fully-featured, extensible client for the Let's
Encrypt CA (or any other CA that speaks the ACME
protocol) that can automate the tasks of obtaining certificates and
configuring webservers to use them. This client runs on Unix-based operating
systems.
To see the changes made to Certbot between versions please refer to our
changelog.
Until May 2016, Certbot was named simply letsencrypt or letsencrypt-auto,
depending on install method. Instructions on the Internet, and some pieces of the
software, may still refer to this older name.

Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project please read Developer Guide.
This project is governed by EFF's Public Projects Code of Conduct.

How to run the client
The easiest way to install and run Certbot is by visiting certbot.eff.org,
where you can find the correct instructions for many web server and OS
combinations.  For more information, see Get Certbot.

Understanding the client in more depth
To understand what the client is doing in detail, it's important to
understand the way it uses plugins.  Please see the explanation of
plugins in
the User Guide.

Current Features

Supports multiple web servers:
apache/2.x
nginx/0.8.48+
webroot (adds files to webroot directories in order to prove control of
domains and obtain certs)
standalone (runs its own simple webserver to prove you control a domain)
other server software via third party plugins


The private key is generated locally on your system.
Can talk to the Let's Encrypt CA or optionally to other ACME
compliant services.
Can get domain-validated (DV) certificates.
Can revoke certificates.
Adjustable RSA key bit-length (2048 (default), 4096, ...).
Can optionally install a http -> https redirect, so your site effectively
runs https only (Apache only)
Fully automated.
Configuration changes are logged and can be reverted.
Supports an interactive text UI, or can be driven entirely from the
command line.
Free and Open Source Software, made with Python.

Video.js - HTML5 Video Player






Video.js is a web video player built from the ground up for an HTML5 world. It supports HTML5 and Flash video, as well as YouTube and Vimeo (through plugins). It supports video playback on desktops and mobile devices. This project was started mid 2010, and the player is now used on over 50,000 100,000 200,000 400,000 websites.

Quick Start
Thanks to the awesome folks over at Fastly, there's a free, CDN hosted version of Video.js that anyone can use. Add these tags to your document's <head>:
<link href=""//vjs.zencdn.net/7.3.0/video-js.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">
<script src=""//vjs.zencdn.net/7.3.0/video.min.js""></script>

For the latest version of video.js and URLs to use, check out the Getting Started page on our website.

Video.js version 7 (and newer) CDN builds do not send any data to Google Analytics.
In older versions of Video.js (6 and earlier), in the vjs.zencdn.net CDN-hosted versions we include a stripped down Google Analytics pixel that tracks a random sampling (currently 1%) of players loaded from the CDN. This allows us to see (roughly) what browsers are in use in the wild, along with other useful metrics such as OS and device. If you'd like to disable analytics, you can simply include the following global before including Video.js via the free CDN:
<script>window.HELP_IMPROVE_VIDEOJS = false;</script>
Alternatively, you can include Video.js by getting it from npm, downloading from GitHub releases or by including it via unpkg or another JavaScript CDN like CDNjs. These releases do not include Google Analytics tracking at all.
<!-- unpkg : use the latest version of Video.js -->
<link href=""https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video-js.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">
<script src=""https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video.min.js""></script>

<script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/video.js/6.7.3/video.min.js""></script>
Next, using Video.js is as simple as creating a <video> element, but with an additional data-setup attribute. At a minimum, this attribute must have a value of '{}', but it can include any Video.js options - just make sure it contains valid JSON!
<video
    id=""my-player""
    class=""video-js""
    controls
    preload=""auto""
    poster=""//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.png""
    data-setup='{}'>
  <source src=""//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4"" type=""video/mp4""></source>
  <source src=""//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.webm"" type=""video/webm""></source>

    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a
    web browser that
    <a href=""https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/"" target=""_blank"">
      supports HTML5 video
    </a>
  </p>
</video>
When the page loads, Video.js will find this element and automatically setup a player in its place.
If you don't want to use automatic setup, you can leave off the data-setup attribute and initialize a <video> element manually using the videojs function:
var player = videojs('my-player');
The videojs function also accepts an options object and a callback to be invoked
when the player is ready:
var options = {};

var player = videojs('my-player', options, function onPlayerReady() {
  videojs.log('Your player is ready!');

  // In this context, `this` is the player that was created by Video.js.
  this.play();

  // How about an event listener?
  this.on('ended', function() {
    videojs.log('Awww...over so soon?!');
  });
});

11th February 2019

With a new version as large as 3.16.0 was, there were bound to be some bugs that got overlooked. With 3.16.2 we address some of the more important ones. Please see the Change Log below for full details. If you're using 3.16, then please upgrade to 3.16.2.
5th February 2019:
I'm pleased to announce that Phaser 3.16 is now available. This version represents a significant milestone in the project as Phaser 3 is now 100% feature complete with all of the initially planned systems now in place. The most significant additions in 3.16 is the overhaul of the Input event handling, the long-awaited introduction of the Scale Manager, and the Extern Game Object, which allows for 3rd party rendering support, as required by Spine. Spine animation support is being handled exclusively through a Phaser Plugin. The current build of the Spine plugin can be found in this repo in the plugins folder, along with examples in the Phaser Labs. The Spine plugin will be developed independently of Phaser in the coming weeks.
This is the single largest update of Phaser 3 yet, and as such, there are breaking changes. I have painstakingly listed all of them in the Change Log, so please do read it if you're upgrading from an earlier version. I know there is a lot to take in, so I'll be covering the new features in the Phaser World newsletter in the coming weeks.
3.16 also brings together all of the hard work from the community that went in to the documentation. They're in a much better state than ever before, and very nearly 100% complete. I also completely reworked the internal event system, so event names, callback arguments and more are easy to find in one central place in the docs and can be reference in your code with either strings or properly name-spaced constants.
A massive thank-you to everyone who supports Phaser on Patreon and PayPal. It's your backing that allows me to work on this full-time. If you've ever considered becoming a backer, now is the perfect time!
As always, please check out the Change Log for comprehensive details about what recent versions contain.
If you'd like to stay abreast of developments then I publish my Developer Logs in the Phaser World newsletter. Subscribe to stay in touch and get all the latest news from the core team and the wider community.
You can also follow Phaser on Twitter and chat with fellow Phaser devs in our Slack and Discord channels.
Phaser 3 wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic support of the community and Patreon. Thank you to everyone who supports our work, who shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming, and Phaser's role in that.
Happy coding everyone!
Cheers,
Rich - @photonstorm


Because Phaser is an open source project, we cannot charge for it in the same way as traditional retail software. What's more, we don't ever want to. After all, it's built on, and was born from, open web standards. It's part of our manifesto that the core framework will always be free, even if you use it commercially, as many of you do.
You may not realize it, but because of this, we rely 100% on community backing to fund development.
Those funds allow Phaser to improve, and when it improves, everyone involved benefits. Your support helps secure a constant cycle of updates, fixes, new features and planning for the future.
There are other benefits to backing Phaser, too:

I use Patreon to manage the backing and you can support Phaser from $1 per month. The amount you pledge is entirely up to you and can be changed as often as you like. Patreon renews monthly, just like Netflix. You can, of course, cancel at any point. Tears will be shed on this end, but that's not your concern.
Extra special thanks to our top-tier sponsors: Orange Games and CrossInstall.



We publish the Phaser World newsletter. It's packed full of the latest Phaser games, tutorials, videos, meet-ups, talks, and more. The newsletter also contains our weekly Development Progress updates which let you know about the new features we're working on.
Over 130 previous editions can be found on our Back Issues page.


Phaser 3 is available via GitHub, npm and CDNs:

Clone the git repository via https, ssh or with the Github Windows or Mac clients.
Download as zip
Download the build files: phaser.js and phaser.min.js

NPM
Install via npm:
npm install phaser
CDN

Phaser is on jsDelivr which is a ""super-fast CDN for developers"". Include the following in your html:
<script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.16.2/dist/phaser.js""></script>
or the minified version:
<script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.16.2/dist/phaser.min.js""></script>
API Documentation
Go to https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/index.html to read the docs online. Use the drop-down menus at the top to navigate the name spaces, classes and Game Objects lists.
Or, if you wish to run the docs locally you can checkout the phaser3-docs repository and then read the documentation by pointing your browser to the docs/ folder.
The documentation for Phaser 3 is an on-going project. Please help us by searching the Phaser code for any instance of the string [description] and then replacing it with some documentation.
TypeScript Definitions
You can find the TypeScript definitions inside the types folder of the main repo. They are also referenced in the types entry in package.json.
The defs are automatically generated from the JSDoc comments found in the Phaser source code. If you wish to help refine them then you must edit the Phaser JSDoc blocks directly, not the defs files. You can find more details about the parser we use in the scripts/tsgen folder in the main repo.
Webpack
We use Webpack to build Phaser and we take advantage of its conditional build flag feature to handle renderer swapping. If you wish to use Webpack with Phaser then please use our Phaser 3 Project Template as it's already set-up to handle the build conditions Phaser needs. Recent changes to our build steps mean you should now be able to use any other packager, like Parcel, without any config changes.

Facebook Instant Games
Phaser 3.13 introduced the new Facebook Instant Games Plugin. The plugin provides a seamless bridge between Phaser and version 6.2 of the Facebook Instant Games SDK. Every single SDK function is available via the plugin and we will keep track of the official SDK to make sure they stay in sync.
The plugin offers the following features:

Easy integration with the Phaser Loader so load events update the Facebook progress circle.
Events for every plugin method, allowing the async calls of the SDK to be correctly inserted into the Phaser game flow. When SDK calls resolve they will surface naturally as a Phaser event and you'll know you can safely act upon them without potentially doing something mid-way through the game step.
All Plugin methods check if the call is part of the supported APIs available in the SDK, without needing to launch an async request first.
Instant access to platform, player and locale data.
Easily load player photos directly into the Texture Manager, ready for use with a Game Object.
Subscribe to game bots.
The plugin has a built-in Data Manager which makes dealing with data stored on Facebook seamless. Just create whatever data properties you need and they are automatically synced.
Support for FB stats, to retrieve, store and increment stats into cloud storage.
Save Session data with built-in session length validation.
Easy context switching, to swap between game instances and session data retrieval.
Easily open a Facebook share, invite, request or game challenge window and populate the text and image content using any image stored in the Texture cache.
Full Leaderboard support. Retrieve, scan and update leaderboard entries, as well as player matching.
Support for in-app purchases, with product catalogs, the ability to handle purchases, get past purchases and consume previously unlocked purchases.
Easily preload a set of interstitial ads, in both banner and video form, then display the ad at any point in your game, with in-built tracking of ads displayed and inventory available.
Plus other features, such as logging to FB Analytics, creating short cuts, switching games, etc.

We've 3 tutorials related to Facebook Instant Games and Phaser:

Displaying Ads in your Instant Games

A special build of Phaser with the Facebook Instant Games Plugin ready-enabled is available on jsDelivr. Include the following in your html:
<script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.16.2/dist/phaser-facebook-instant-games.js""></script>
or the minified version:
<script src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.16.2/dist/phaser-facebook-instant-games.min.js""></script>
The build files are in the git repository in the dist folder, and you can also include the plugin in custom builds.
Source Code Examples
During our development of Phaser 3, we created hundreds of examples with the full source code and assets ready available. Until these examples are fully integrated into the Phaser website, you can browse them on Phaser 3 Labs, or clone the examples repo. We are constantly adding to and refining these examples.
Create Your First Phaser 3 Example
Create an index.html page locally and paste the following code into it:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.16.2/dist/phaser-arcade-physics.min.js""></script> 
</head>
<body>

    <script></script>

</body>
</html>
This is a standard empty webpage. You'll notice there's a script tag that is pulling in a build of Phaser 3, but otherwise this webpage doesn't do anything yet. Now let's set-up the game config. Paste the following between the <script></script> tags:
var config = {
    type: Phaser.AUTO,
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    physics: {
        default: 'arcade',
        arcade: {
            gravity: { y: 200 }
        }
    },
    scene: {
        preload: preload,
        create: create
    }
};
config is a pretty standard Phaser 3 Game Configuration object. We tell config to use the WebGL renderer if it can, set the canvas to a size of 800x600 pixels, enable Arcade Physics, and finally call the preload and create functions. preload and create have not been implemented yet, so if you run this JavaScript code, you will have an error. Add the following after config:
var game = new Phaser.Game(config);

function preload ()
{
    this.load.setBaseURL('http://labs.phaser.io');

    this.load.image('sky', 'assets/skies/space3.png');
    this.load.image('logo', 'assets/sprites/phaser3-logo.png');
    this.load.image('red', 'assets/particles/red.png');
}

function create ()
{
}
game is a Phaser Game instance that uses our configuration object config. We also add function definitions for preload and create. The preload function helps you easily load assets into your game. In preload, we set the Base URL to be the Phaser server and load 3 PNG files.
The create function is empty, so it's time to fill it in:
function create ()
{
    this.add.image(400, 300, 'sky');

    var particles = this.add.particles('red');

    var emitter = particles.createEmitter({
        speed: 100,
        scale: { start: 1, end: 0 },
        blendMode: 'ADD'
    });

    var logo = this.physics.add.image(400, 100, 'logo');

    logo.setVelocity(100, 200);
    logo.setBounce(1, 1);
    logo.setCollideWorldBounds(true);

    emitter.startFollow(logo);
}
Here we add a sky image into the game and create a Particle Emitter. The scale value means that the particles will initially be large and will shrink to nothing as their lifespan progresses.
After creating the emitter, we add a logo image called logo. Since logo is a Physics Image, logo is given a physics body by default. We set some properties for logo: velocity, bounce (or restitution), and collision with the world bounds. These properties will make our logo bounce around the screen. Finally, we tell the particle emitter to follow the logo - so as the logo moves, the particles will flow from it.
Run it in your browser and you'll see the following:

(Got an error? Here's the full code)
This is a tiny example, and there are hundreds more for you to explore, but hopefully it shows how expressive and quick Phaser is to use. With just a few easily readable lines of code, we've got something pretty impressive up on screen!
Subscribe to our newsletter for further tutorials and examples.

There are both plain and minified compiled versions of Phaser in the dist folder of the repository. The plain version is for use during development, and the minified version is for production use. You can also create your own builds.
Custom Builds
Phaser 3 is built using Webpack and we take advantage of the Webpack definePlugin feature to allow for conditional building of the Canvas and WebGL renderers and extra plugins. You can custom the build process to only include the features you require. Doing so can cut the main build file size down to just 70KB.
Read our comprehensive guide on creating Custom Builds of Phaser 3 for full details.
Building from Source
If you wish to build Phaser 3 from source, ensure you have the required packages by cloning the repository and then running npm install on your source directory.
You can then run webpack to create a development build in the build folder which includes source maps for local testing. You can also npm run dist to create a minified packaged build in the dist folder. For a list of all commands available use npm run help.


Change Log
Version 3.16.2 - Ishikawa - 11th February 2019
This is point release primarily fixes a few important issues that surfaced in 3.16.0. Please be sure to read the Change Log if you are coming from a version < 3.16.0 as it contains lots of important updates.
Matter Pointer Constraint Changes
The following changes all effect the Matter JS Pointer Constraint class:

Pointer handling has been changed to make more sense. In the previous version, pressing down and then moving the Pointer over a body would start it being dragged, even if the pointer was pressed down well outside of the body bounds. Now, a body can only be dragged by actually pressing down on it, or any of its parts, which is more in-line with how input events should work.
Previously, releasing ANY pointer would stop an object being dragged, even if it wasn't the one actually dragging a body, as in a multi-touch game. Bodies are now bound to the pointer which started their drag and only the release of that pointer will stop them.
There is a new Matter Physics Event DRAG_START which is emitted by a Pointer Constraint when it starts dragging a body. Listen for this event from the Matter World instance.
There is a new Matter Physics Event DRAG which is emitted by a Pointer Constraint as it drags a body. Listen for this event from the Matter World instance.
There is a new Matter Physics Event DRAG_END which is emitted by a Pointer Constraint when it stops dragging a body. Listen for this event from the Matter World instance.
The camera property can no longer be set in the config object. Instead it is set every time the Pointer is pressed down on a Body, this resolves issues where you have a multi-camera Scene and want to drag a body in the non-main camera.
body is a new property that holds a reference to the Body being dragged, if any.
part is a new property that holds a reference to the Body part that was clicked on which started the drag.
The internal getBodyPart method has been renamed to hitTestBody to more accurately reflect what it does.
The class no longer listens for the pointer up event, instead of tracks the active pointer and waits for that to be released. This has reduced the complexity and size of the update method considerably.
stopDrag is a new method that allows you to manually stop an object being dragged, even if the pointer isn't released.
This class now has 100% JSDocs.

Updates

TileSprite.setTileScale has been updated so that the y argument is optional and set to match the x argument, like setScale elsewhere in the API.
InputManager.time is a new property that holds the most recent time it was updated from the Game step, which plugins can access.
InputManager.preStep is a new method that populates some internal properties every step.
KeyboardPlugin.time has moved from being a property to being a getter, which returns the time from the InputManager.
The scale property has been added to the Scene class (thanks @strangeweekend)
Matter.World.remove now uses the Composite.remove method internally. Previously, it used Composite.removeBody which only allowed it to remove bodies from the simulation. Now, it can remove any type of Matter object.
When the Matter World creates its wall bounds, the left and right walls now extend further up and down than before, so that in a 4-wall setting there are no gaps in the corners, which previously allowed for fast moving objects that hit a corner intersection point to sometimes travel through it.
Touch inputs will now trigger a POINTER_OUT event if they leave the game (i.e. are released), where-as before they would only trigger the POINTER_UP event. Now, both happen (thanks @rgk)

Bug Fixes

The Mesh.setAlpha method has been restored, even though it's empty and does nothing, to prevent runtime errors when adding a Mesh or Quad object to a Container. Fix #4338 #4343 (thanks @pfdtravalmatic @charmingny)
KeyboardPlugin.checkDown would always fail if using the new event system, because the time value it was checking wasn't updated.
Entering Fullscreen mode in the Scale Manager and then pressing ESC would leave the injected fullscreen div in the DOM, causing it to throw a node insertion failure the second time you wanted to enter fullscreen mode. Fix #4352 (thanks @ngdevr)
Due to the changes in the Input event system, the GAME_OUT event would never fire unless the input system was in legacy mode. The OUT and OVER handlers have been refactored and will now fire as soon as the DOM event happens. As a result the InputManager._emitIsOverEvent property has been removed, as the native event is sent directly to the handler and doesn't need storing locally any more. Fix #4344 (thanks @RademCZ)
Added Zone.setBlendMode method as a NOOP function, fixing a bug where if you added a Zone to a Container when running under Canvas it would fail. Fix #4295 (thanks @emanuel15)

etcd








Note: The master branch may be in an unstable or even broken state during development. Please use releases instead of the master branch in order to get stable binaries.

etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

Simple: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
Secure: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
Fast: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
Reliable: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the Raft consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.
etcd is used in production by many companies, and the development team stands behind it in critical deployment scenarios, where etcd is frequently teamed with applications such as Kubernetes, locksmith, vulcand, Doorman, and many others. Reliability is further ensured by rigorous testing.
See etcdctl for a simple command line client.
Community meetings
Community meeting will resume at 11:00 am on Thursday, January 10th, 2019.
etcd contributors and maintainers have monthly (every four weeks) meetings at 11:00 AM (USA Pacific) on Thursday.
An initial agenda will be posted to the shared Google docs a day before each meeting, and everyone is welcome to suggest additional topics or other agendas.
Please download and import the following iCalendar (.ics) files to calendar system.

Getting started
Getting etcd
The easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, and Docker on the release page.
For more installation guides, please check out play.etcd.io and operating etcd.
For those wanting to try the very latest version, build the latest version of etcd from the master branch. This first needs Go installed (version 1.11+ is required). All development occurs on master, including new features and bug fixes. Bug fixes are first targeted at master and subsequently ported to release branches, as described in the branch management guide.
Running etcd
First start a single-member cluster of etcd.
If etcd is installed using the pre-built release binaries, run it from the installation location as below:
/tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd
The etcd command can be simply run as such if it is moved to the system path as below:
mv /tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd /usr/local/bin/
etcd
If etcd is built from the master branch, run it as below:
./bin/etcd
This will bring up etcd listening on port 2379 for client communication and on port 2380 for server-to-server communication.
Next, let's set a single key, and then retrieve it:
etcdctl put mykey ""this is awesome""
etcdctl get mykey

etcd is now running and serving client requests. For more, please check out:

Interactive etcd playground
Animated quick demo

etcd TCP ports
The official etcd ports are 2379 for client requests, and 2380 for peer communication.
Running a local etcd cluster
First install goreman, which manages Procfile-based applications.
Our Procfile script will set up a local example cluster. Start it with:
goreman start
This will bring up 3 etcd members infra1, infra2 and infra3 and etcd grpc-proxy, which runs locally and composes a cluster.
Every cluster member and proxy accepts key value reads and key value writes.
Next steps
Now it's time to dig into the full etcd API and other guides.

Read the full documentation.
Explore the full gRPC API.
Set up a multi-machine cluster.
Learn the config format, env variables and flags.
Find language bindings and tools.
Use TLS to secure an etcd cluster.
Tune etcd.

Deep Learning 中文翻译
在众多网友的帮助和校对下，中文版终于出版了。尽管还有很多问题，但至少90%的内容是可读的，并且是准确的。
我们尽可能地保留了原书Deep Learning中的意思并保留原书的语句。
然而我们水平有限，我们无法消除众多读者的方差。我们仍需要大家的建议和帮助，一起减小翻译的偏差。
大家所要做的就是阅读，然后汇总你的建议，提issue（最好不要一个一个地提）。如果你确定你的建议不需要商量，可以直接发起PR。
对应的翻译者：

第1、4、7、10、14、20章及第12.4、12.5节由 @swordyork 负责
第2、5、8、11、15、18章由 @liber145 负责
第3、6、9章由 @KevinLee1110 负责
第13、16、17、19章及第12.1至12.3节由 @futianfan 负责

面向的读者
请直接下载PDF阅读。
不打算提供EPUB等格式，如有需要请自行修改。
这一版准确性已经有所提高，读者可以以中文版为主、英文版为辅来阅读学习，但我们仍建议研究者阅读原版。
出版及开源原因
本书由人民邮电出版社出版，如果你觉得中文版PDF对你有所帮助，希望你能支持下纸质正版书籍。
如果你觉得中文版不行，希望你能多提建议。非常感谢各位！
纸质版也会进一步更新，需要大家更多的建议和意见，一起完善中文版。
纸质版目前在人民邮电出版社的异步社区出售，见地址。
价格不低，但看了样本之后，我们认为物有所值。
注意，我们不会通过媒体进行宣传，希望大家先看电子版内容，再判断是否购买纸质版。
以下是开源的具体原因：

我们不是文学工作者，不专职翻译。单靠我们，无法给出今天的翻译，众多网友都给我们提出了宝贵的建议，因此开源帮了很大的忙。出版社会给我们稿费（我们也不知道多少，可能2万左右），我们也不好意思自己用，商量之后觉得捐出是最合适的，以所有贡献过的网友的名义（我们把稿费捐给了杉树公益，用于4名贵州高中生三年的生活费，见捐赠情况）。
PDF电子版对于技术类书籍来说是很重要的，随时需要查询，拿着纸质版到处走显然不合适。国外很多技术书籍都有对应的电子版（虽然不一定是正版），而国内的几乎没有。个人认为这是出版社或者作者认为国民素质还没有高到主动为知识付费的境界，所以不愿意""泄露""电子版。时代在进步，我们也需要改变。特别是翻译作品普遍质量不高的情况下，要敢为天下先。
深度学习发展太快，日新月异，所以我们希望大家更早地学到相关的知识。我觉得原作者开放PDF电子版也有类似的考虑，也就是先阅读后付费。我们认为中国人口素质已经足够高，懂得为知识付费。当然这不是付给我们的，是付给出版社的，出版社再付给原作者。我们不希望中文版的销量因PDF电子版的存在而下滑。出版社只有值回了版权才能在以后引进更多的优秀书籍。我们这个开源翻译先例也不会成为一个反面案例，以后才会有更多的PDF电子版。
开源也涉及版权问题，出于版权原因，我们不再更新此初版PDF文件，请大家以最终的纸质版为准。（但源码会一直更新）

致谢
我们有3个类别的校对人员。

负责人也就是对应的翻译者。
简单阅读，对语句不通顺或难以理解的地方提出修改意见。
中英对比，进行中英对应阅读，排除少翻错翻的情况。

所有校对建议都保存在各章的annotations.txt文件中。

Apache Superset
Apache Superset is a data exploration and visualization web application.
Superset provides:

An intuitive interface to explore and visualize datasets, and
create interactive dashboards.
A wide array of beautiful visualizations to showcase your data.
Easy, code-free, user flows to drill down and slice and dice the data
underlying exposed dashboards. The dashboards and charts acts as a starting
point for deeper analysis.
A state of the art SQL editor/IDE exposing a rich metadata browser, and
an easy workflow to create visualizations out of any result set.
An extensible, high granularity security model allowing intricate rules
on who can access which product features and datasets.
Integration with major
authentication backends (database, OpenID, LDAP, OAuth, REMOTE_USER, ...)
A lightweight semantic layer, allowing to control how data sources are
exposed to the user by defining dimensions and metrics
Out of the box support for most SQL-speaking databases
Deep integration with Druid allows for Superset to stay blazing fast while
slicing and dicing large, realtime datasets
Fast loading dashboards with configurable caching

Database Support
Superset speaks many SQL dialects through SQLAlchemy, a Python
ORM that is compatible with
most common databases.
Superset can be used to visualize data out of most databases:

MySQL
Postgres
Vertica
Oracle
Microsoft SQL Server
SQLite
Greenplum
Firebird
MariaDB
Sybase
IBM DB2
Exasol
MonetDB
Snowflake
Redshift
Clickhouse
Apache Kylin
Google BigQuery
more! look for the availability of a SQLAlchemy dialect for your database
to find out whether it will work with Superset

Apache Druid (Incubating)!
On top of having the ability to query your relational databases,
Superset ships with deep integration with Druid (a real time distributed
column-store). When querying Druid,
Superset can query humongous amounts of data on top of real time dataset.
Note that Superset does not require Druid in any way to function, it's simply
another database backend that it can query.
Here's a description of Druid from the http://druid.io website:
Druid is an open-source analytics data store designed for
business intelligence (OLAP) queries on event data. Druid provides low
latency (real-time) data ingestion, flexible data exploration,
and fast data aggregation. Existing Druid deployments have scaled to
trillions of events and petabytes of data. Druid is best used to
power analytic dashboards and applications.

Helping you select an MV* framework

Website    Blog    TasteJS


Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an MV* framework for structuring and organizing JavaScript web apps.
Backbone, Ember, AngularJS... the list of new and stable solutions goes on and on, but just how do you decide on which to use in a sea of so many options?
To help solve this problem, we created TodoMVC - a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV* frameworks of today.
Team
TodoMVC would not be possible without a strong team of contributors helping push the project forward each day. Additionally, we have a core project team composed of:
Addy Osmani - Founder/Lead

  Addy is a Software Engineer at Google who originally created TodoMVC. He oversees the project direction, maintenance and organizes the planning and development efforts of the team.
Sindre Sorhus - Lead Developer

Sindre is a Web Developer who leads core development, quality control and application design for the project. His engineering contributions have helped us ensure consistency and best practices are enforced wherever possible. Sindre also leads up development of the TodoMVC application spec.
Pascal Hartig - Developer

Pascal is a Software Engineer at Twitter with a deep passion for consistency. He watches pull requests and helps developers getting their contributions integrated with TodoMVC.
Stephen Sawchuk - Developer

Stephen is a Front-end Engineer at Quicken Loans that cares about improving the maintainability and developer experience of open-source projects. His recent contributions include helping us move all apps over to using Bower and implementing the new information bar.
Colin Eberhardt - Developer

Colin is a software consultant at Scott Logic who is passionate about all software - from JavaScript to Java, and C# to Objective-C. His recent contribution to the project has been a fully automated test suite.
Sam Saccone - Developer

Sam is a Software Engineer at Google who is driven by an endless desire to create, solve problems, and improve developers' lives.
Arthur Verschaeve - Developer

Arthur is an open-source fanboy from Belgium. He is passionate about developer tooling and all things JavaScript.
Fady Samir Sadek - Developer

Fady is a front-end developer who loves all things JavaScript and enjoys solving real world problems using the web platform and helping other developers do the same. He currently leads maintenance of the project and ensures that the project is friendly for new contributors and upcoming developers.
Gianni Chiappetta - Logo designer

Gianni is a programmer and designer currently working as the Chief Rigger at MetaLab.
Disclaimer

TodoMVC has been called many things including the 'Speed-dating' and 'Rosetta Stone' of MV* frameworks. Whilst we hope that this project can offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of a framework's potential capability.
It is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured, and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.
Also, please keep in mind that TodoMVC is not the perfect way to compare the size of different frameworks. We intentionally use the unminified versions to make reading the source code easier.
Getting Involved
Whilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing Todo apps, we're always interested in speaking to framework authors (and users) wishing to share Todo app implementations in their framework/solution of choice.

Certbot is part of EFF’s effort to encrypt the entire Internet. Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identity of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?). Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs). Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from Let’s Encrypt—an open certificate authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others—and deploys it to a web server.
Anyone who has gone through the trouble of setting up a secure website knows what a hassle getting and maintaining a certificate is. Certbot and Let’s Encrypt can automate away the pain and let you turn on and manage HTTPS with simple commands. Using Certbot and Let's Encrypt is free, so there’s no need to arrange payment.
How you use Certbot depends on the configuration of your web server. The best way to get started is to use our interactive guide. It generates instructions based on your configuration settings. In most cases, you’ll need root or administrator access to your web server to run Certbot.
Certbot is meant to be run directly on your web server, not on your personal computer. If you’re using a hosted service and don’t have direct access to your web server, you might not be able to use Certbot. Check with your hosting provider for documentation about uploading certificates or using certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt.
Certbot is a fully-featured, extensible client for the Let's
Encrypt CA (or any other CA that speaks the ACME
protocol) that can automate the tasks of obtaining certificates and
configuring webservers to use them. This client runs on Unix-based operating
systems.
To see the changes made to Certbot between versions please refer to our
changelog.
Until May 2016, Certbot was named simply letsencrypt or letsencrypt-auto,
depending on install method. Instructions on the Internet, and some pieces of the
software, may still refer to this older name.

Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project please read Developer Guide.
This project is governed by EFF's Public Projects Code of Conduct.

How to run the client
The easiest way to install and run Certbot is by visiting certbot.eff.org,
where you can find the correct instructions for many web server and OS
combinations.  For more information, see Get Certbot.

Understanding the client in more depth
To understand what the client is doing in detail, it's important to
understand the way it uses plugins.  Please see the explanation of
plugins in
the User Guide.

Video.js - HTML5 Video Player






Video.js is a web video player built from the ground up for an HTML5 world. It supports HTML5 and Flash video, as well as YouTube and Vimeo (through plugins). It supports video playback on desktops and mobile devices. This project was started mid 2010, and the player is now used on over 50,000 100,000 200,000 400,000 websites.

Quick Start
Thanks to the awesome folks over at Fastly, there's a free, CDN hosted version of Video.js that anyone can use. Add these tags to your document's <head>:
<link href=""//vjs.zencdn.net/7.3.0/video-js.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">
<script src=""//vjs.zencdn.net/7.3.0/video.min.js""></script>

For the latest version of video.js and URLs to use, check out the Getting Started page on our website.

Video.js version 7 (and newer) CDN builds do not send any data to Google Analytics.
In older versions of Video.js (6 and earlier), in the vjs.zencdn.net CDN-hosted versions we include a stripped down Google Analytics pixel that tracks a random sampling (currently 1%) of players loaded from the CDN. This allows us to see (roughly) what browsers are in use in the wild, along with other useful metrics such as OS and device. If you'd like to disable analytics, you can simply include the following global before including Video.js via the free CDN:
<script>window.HELP_IMPROVE_VIDEOJS = false;</script>
Alternatively, you can include Video.js by getting it from npm, downloading from GitHub releases or by including it via unpkg or another JavaScript CDN like CDNjs. These releases do not include Google Analytics tracking at all.
<!-- unpkg : use the latest version of Video.js -->
<link href=""https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video-js.min.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">
<script src=""https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video.min.js""></script>

<!-- unpkg : use a specific version of Video.js (change the version numbers as necessary) -->

<script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/video.js/6.7.3/video.min.js""></script>
Next, using Video.js is as simple as creating a <video> element, but with an additional data-setup attribute. At a minimum, this attribute must have a value of '{}', but it can include any Video.js options - just make sure it contains valid JSON!
<video
    id=""my-player""
    class=""video-js""
    controls
    preload=""auto""
    poster=""//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.png""

    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a

    <a href=""https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/"" target=""_blank"">
      supports HTML5 video
    </a>
  </p>
</video>
When the page loads, Video.js will find this element and automatically setup a player in its place.
If you don't want to use automatic setup, you can leave off the data-setup attribute and initialize a <video> element manually using the videojs function:
var player = videojs('my-player');
The videojs function also accepts an options object and a callback to be invoked
when the player is ready:
var options = {};

var player = videojs('my-player', options, function onPlayerReady() {
  videojs.log('Your player is ready!');

  // In this context, `this` is the player that was created by Video.js.
  this.play();

  // How about an event listener?
  this.on('ended', function() {
    videojs.log('Awww...over so soon?!');
  });
});

Face Recognition
You can also read a translated version of this file in Chinese 简体中文版.
Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with
the world's simplest face recognition library.
Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the
Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
This also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets
you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!



Features
Find faces in pictures
Find all the faces that appear in a picture:

import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""your_file.jpg"")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
Find and manipulate facial features in pictures
Get the locations and outlines of each person's eyes, nose, mouth and chin.

import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""your_file.jpg"")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)
Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff. But you can also use it for really stupid stuff
like applying digital make-up (think 'Meitu'):

Identify faces in pictures
Recognize who appears in each photo.

import face_recognition
known_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""biden.jpg"")
unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""unknown.jpg"")

biden_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_image)[0]
unknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image)[0]

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([biden_encoding], unknown_encoding)
You can even use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition:

See this example for the code.

Installation
Requirements

Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7
macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported, but might work)

Installation Options:
Installing on Mac or Linux
First, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:

How to install dlib from source on macOS or Ubuntu

Then, install this module from pypi using pip3 (or pip2 for Python 2):
pip3 install face_recognition
Alternatively, you can try this library with Docker, see this section.
If you are having trouble with installation, you can also try out a
pre-configured VM.
Installing on Raspberry Pi 2+

Raspberry Pi 2+ installation instructions

Installing on Windows
While Windows isn't officially supported, helpful users have posted instructions on how to install this library:

@masoudr's Windows 10 installation guide (dlib + face_recognition)

Installing a pre-configured Virtual Machine image

Download the pre-configured VM image (for VMware Player or VirtualBox).

Usage
Command-Line Interface
When you install face_recognition, you get two simple command-line
programs:

face_recognition - Recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for
photographs.
face_detection - Find faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.

face_recognition command line tool
The face_recognition command lets you recognize faces in a photograph or
folder full  for photographs.
First, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person you
already know. There should be one image file for each person with the
files named according to who is in the picture:

Next, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:

Then in you simply run the command face_recognition, passing in
the folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with unknown
people and it tells you who is in each image:
$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person
There's one line in the output for each face. The data is comma-separated
with the filename and the name of the person found.
An unknown_person is a face in the image that didn't match anyone in
your folder of known people.
face_detection command line tool
The face_detection command lets you find the location (pixel coordinatates)
of any faces in an image.
Just run the command face_detection, passing in a folder of images
to check (or a single image):
$ face_detection  ./folder_with_pictures/

examples/image1.jpg,65,215,169,112
examples/image2.jpg,62,394,211,244
examples/image2.jpg,95,941,244,792
It prints one line for each face that was detected. The coordinates
reported are the top, right, bottom and left coordinates of the face (in pixels).
Adjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity
If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be that
the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value
is needed to make face comparisons more strict.
You can do that with the --tolerance parameter. The default tolerance
value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:
$ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person
If you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in order
to adjust the tolerance setting, you can use --show-distance true:
$ face_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,None
More Examples
If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but don't
care about file names, you could do this:
$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2

Barack Obama
unknown_person
Speeding up Face Recognition
Face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with
multiple CPU cores. For example, if your system has 4 CPU cores, you can
process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by using
all your CPU cores in parallel.
If you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a --cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use> parameter:
$ face_recognition --cpus 4 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/
You can also pass in --cpus -1 to use all CPU cores in your system.
Python Module
You can import the face_recognition module and then easily manipulate
faces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!
API Docs: https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io.
Automatically find all the faces in an image
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""my_picture.jpg"")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
See this example
to try it out.
You can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face detection model.
Note: GPU acceleration (via NVidia's CUDA library) is required for good
performance with this model. You'll also want to enable CUDA support
when compliling dlib.
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""my_picture.jpg"")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image, model=""cnn"")

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
See this example
to try it out.
If you have a lot of images and a GPU, you can also
find faces in batches.
Automatically locate the facial features of a person in an image
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""my_picture.jpg"")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

# face_landmarks_list is now an array with the locations of each facial feature in each face.
# face_landmarks_list[0]['left_eye'] would be the location and outline of the first person's left eye.
See this example
to try it out.
Recognize faces in images and identify who they are
import face_recognition

picture_of_me = face_recognition.load_image_file(""me.jpg"")
my_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(picture_of_me)[0]

# my_face_encoding now contains a universal 'encoding' of my facial features that can be compared to any other picture of a face!

unknown_picture = face_recognition.load_image_file(""unknown.jpg"")
unknown_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_picture)[0]

# Now we can see the two face encodings are of the same person with `compare_faces`!

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([my_face_encoding], unknown_face_encoding)

if results[0] == True:
    print(""It's a picture of me!"")
else:
    print(""It's not a picture of me!"")
See this example
to try it out.

How Face Recognition Works
If you want to learn how face location and recognition work instead of
depending on a black box library, read my article.
Caveats

The face recognition model is trained on adults and does not work very well on children. It tends to mix
up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.
Accuracy may vary between ethnic groups. Please see this wiki page for more details.

Deployment to Cloud Hosts (Heroku, AWS, etc)
Since face_recognition depends on dlib which is written in C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app
using it to a cloud hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.
To make things easier, there's an example Dockerfile in this repo that shows how to run an app built with
face_recognition in a Docker container. With that, you should be able to deploy
to any service that supports Docker images.
You can try the Docker image locally by running: docker-compose up --build
Linux users with a GPU (drivers >= 384.81) and Nvidia-Docker installed can run the example on the GPU: Open the docker-compose.yml file and uncomment the dockerfile: Dockerfile.gpu and runtime: nvidia lines.

Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress 💅



  





Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!
styled-components is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native – meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the documentation about React Native for more information.
Supported by Front End Center. Thank you for making this possible!
v5
Principal development of v5 has begun! Follow along on the canary branch and check out the current list of roadmap items.
We will be publishing alpha versions to styled-components@canary on NPM as we get closer to a beta release.
Please keep in mind that all development of styled-components is driven by volunteer effort, so things will take as long as they take. We appreciate your enthusiasm and interest as new technologies and patterns emerge.

// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with
// some padding and a papayawhip background
const Wrapper = styled.section`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
`;

// Use them like any other React component – except they're styled!
<Wrapper>
  <Title>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title>
</Wrapper>
This is what you'll see in your browser:





Babel Macro
If you're using tooling that has babel-plugin-macros set up, you can switch to the styled-components/macro import path instead to gain the effects of the babel plugin without further setup.
import styled from 'styled-components/macro';

// A static className will be generated for Title (important for SSR)
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;
If you wish to provide configuration options to the babel plugin similar to how you would in a .babelrc, see this guide. The config name is ""styledComponents"".
Built with styled-components
A lot of hard work goes into community libraries, projects, and guides. A lot of them make it easier to get started or help you with your next project! There’s also a whole lot of interesting apps and sites that people have built using styled-components.
Make sure to head over to awesome-styled-components to see them all! And please contribute and add your own work to the list so others can find it.

New Asynchronous Event Listeners
Often times people want to know when an asynchronous test is done so they can allow their application to react to it.
In the past, you've had to rely on watching properties or <html> classes. Only events on asynchronous tests are
supported. Synchronous tests should be handled synchronously to improve speed and to maintain consistency.
The new API looks like this:
// Listen to a test, give it a callback
Modernizr.on('testname', function( result ) {
  if (result) {
    console.log('The test passed!');
  }
  else {
    console.log('The test failed!');
  }
});
We guarantee that we'll only invoke your function once (per time that you call on). We are currently not exposing
a method for exposing the trigger functionality. Instead, if you'd like to have control over async tests, use the
src/addTest feature, and any test that you set will automatically expose and trigger the on functionality.
Getting Started

Clone or download the repository
Install project dependencies with npm install

Test suite
Run the test suite
Building Modernizr v3
To generate everything in 'config-all.json':
npm install
./bin/modernizr -c lib/config-all.json
//outputs to ./modernizr.js
To run tests on the console (in phantom):
grunt test
To run tests in the browser:
grunt browserResults
then visit http://localhost:9090/test/unit.html for unit test results
or visit http://localhost:9090/test/index.html to see which features that browser supports
To see the build tool:

checkout the modernizr.com code
install all your gems and bundles and jekyll
jekyll
serve ./_sites
visit /download
It should be just a big list of things you can build with no frills.

API Reference
Modernizr can be used programmatically via npm:
var modernizr = require(""modernizr"");
Building
A build method is exposed for generating custom Modernizr builds. Example:
var modernizr = require(""modernizr"");

modernizr.build({}, function (result) {
  console.log(result); // the build
});
The first parameter takes a JSON object of options and feature-detects to include. See lib/config-all.json for all available options.
The second parameter is a function invoked on task completion.

Select2



Select2 is a jQuery-based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching,
remote data sets, and pagination of results.
To get started, checkout examples and documentation at
https://select2.org/
Use cases

Enhancing native selects with search.
Enhancing native selects with a better multi-select interface.
Loading data from JavaScript: easily load items via AJAX and have them
searchable.
Nesting optgroups: native selects only support one level of nesting. Select2
does not have this restriction.
Tagging: ability to add new items on the fly.
Working with large, remote datasets: ability to partially load a dataset based
on the search term.
Paging of large datasets: easy support for loading more pages when the results
are scrolled to the end.
Templating: support for custom rendering of results and selections.

Browser compatibility

IE 8+
Chrome 8+
Firefox 10+
Safari 3+
Opera 10.6+

Select2 is automatically tested on the following browsers.

Usage
You can source Select2 directly from a CDN like JSDliver or
CDNJS, download it from this GitHub repo, or use one of
the integrations below.
Integrations
Third party developers have created plugins for platforms which allow Select2 to be integrated more natively and quickly. For many platforms, additional plugins are not required because Select2 acts as a standard <select> box.
Plugins

Django

django-autocomplete-light
django-easy-select2
django-select2


Drupal - drupal-select2
Meteor - meteor-select2
Ruby on Rails - select2-rails
Wicket - wicketstuff-select2
Yii 2 - yii2-widget-select2
Angularjs - mdr-angular-select2

Themes

Bootstrap 3 - select2-bootstrap-theme
Bootstrap 4 - select2-bootstrap4-theme
Flat UI - select2-flat-theme
Metro UI - select2-metro

Missing an integration? Modify this README and make a pull request back here to Select2 on GitHub.
Internationalization (i18n)
Select2 supports multiple languages by simply including the right language JS
file (dist/js/i18n/it.js, dist/js/i18n/nl.js, etc.) after
dist/js/select2.js.
Missing a language? Just copy src/js/select2/i18n/en.js, translate it, and
make a pull request back to Select2 here on GitHub.
Documentation
The documentation for Select2 is available
through GitHub Pages and is located within this repository
in the docs folder.
Community
You can find out about the different ways to get in touch with the Select2
community at the Select2 community page.

mermaid




Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.
Ever wanted to simplify documentation and avoid heavy tools like Visio when explaining your code?
This is why mermaid was born, a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript.

Request for assistance
Things are piling up and I have hard time keeping up. To remedy this
it would be great if we could form a core team of developers to cooperate
with the future development mermaid.
As part of this team you would get write access to the repository and would
represent the project when answering questions and issues.
Together we could continue the work with things like:

adding more typers of diagrams like mindmaps, ert digrams etc
improving existing diagrams

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to get involved.
For contributors
Setup
yarn install

Build
yarn build:watch

Lint

Why an Open Guide?
A lot of information on AWS is already written. Most people learn AWS by reading a blog or a “getting started guide” and referring to the standard AWS references. Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and recommendations aren’t easy to come by. AWS’s own documentation is a great but sprawling resource few have time to read fully, and it doesn’t include anything but official facts, so omits experiences of engineers. The information in blogs or Stack Overflow is also not consistently up to date.
This guide is by and for engineers who use AWS. It aims to be a useful, living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices. It arose from discussion and editing over beers by several engineers who have used AWS extensively.
Before using the guide, please read the license and disclaimer.
Please help!
This is an early in-progress draft! It’s our first attempt at assembling this information, so is far from comprehensive still, and likely to have omissions or errors.

Please help by joining the Slack channel (we like to talk about AWS in general, even if you only have questions — discussion helps the community and guides improvements) and contributing to the guide. This guide is open to contributions, so unlike a blog, it can keep improving. Like any open source effort, we combine efforts but also review to ensure high quality.
Scope

Currently, this guide covers selected “core” services, such as EC2, S3, Load Balancers, EBS, and IAM, and partial details and tips around other services. We expect it to expand.
It is not a tutorial, but rather a collection of information you can read and return to. It is for both beginners and the experienced.
The goal of this guide is to be:

Brief: Keep it dense and use links
Practical: Basic facts, concrete details, advice, gotchas, and other “folk knowledge”
Current: We can keep updating it, and anyone can contribute improvements
Thoughtful: The goal is to be helpful rather than present dry facts. Thoughtful opinion with rationale is welcome. Suggestions, notes, and opinions based on real experience can be extremely valuable. (We believe this is both possible with a guide of this format, unlike in some other venues.)


This guide is not sponsored by AWS or AWS-affiliated vendors. It is written by and for engineers who use AWS.

General Information
When to Use AWS

AWS is the dominant public cloud computing provider.

In general, “cloud computing” can refer to one of three types of cloud: “public,” “private,” and “hybrid.” AWS is a public cloud provider, since anyone can use it. Private clouds are within a single (usually large) organization. Many companies use a hybrid of private and public clouds.
The core features of AWS are infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) — that is, virtual machines and supporting infrastructure. Other cloud service models include platform-as-a-service (PaaS), which typically are more fully managed services that deploy customers’ applications, or software-as-a-service (SaaS), which are cloud-based applications. AWS does offer a few products that fit into these other models, too.
In business terms, with infrastructure-as-a-service you have a variable cost model — it is OpEx, not CapEx (though some pre-purchased contracts are still CapEx).


AWS’s annual revenue was $17.46 billion in 2017 according to their SEC 10-K filing, or roughly 10% of Amazon.com’s total 2017 revenue.
Main reasons to use AWS:

If your company is building systems or products that may need to scale
and you have technical know-how
and you want the most flexible tools
and you’re not significantly tied into different infrastructure already
and you don’t have internal, regulatory, or compliance reasons you can’t use a public cloud-based solution
and you’re not on a Microsoft-first tech stack
and you don’t have a specific reason to use Google Cloud
and you can afford, manage, or negotiate its somewhat higher costs
... then AWS is likely a good option for your company.


Each of those reasons above might point to situations where other services are preferable. In practice, many, if not most, tech startups as well as a number of modern large companies can or already do benefit from using AWS. Many large enterprises are partly migrating internal infrastructure to Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS.
Costs: Billing and cost management are such big topics that we have an entire section on this.
🔹EC2 vs. other services: Most users of AWS are most familiar with EC2, AWS’ flagship virtual server product, and possibly a few others like S3 and CLBs. But AWS products now extend far beyond basic IaaS, and often companies do not properly understand or appreciate all the many AWS services and how they can be applied, due to the sharply growing number of services, their novelty and complexity, branding confusion, and fear of ⛓lock-in to proprietary AWS technology. Although a bit daunting, it’s important for technical decision-makers in companies to understand the breadth of the AWS services and make informed decisions. (We hope this guide will help.)
🚪AWS vs. other cloud providers: While AWS is the dominant IaaS provider (31% market share in this 2016 estimate), there is significant competition and alternatives that are better suited to some companies. This Gartner report has a good overview of the major cloud players :

Google Cloud Platform. GCP arrived later to market than AWS, but has vast resources and is now used widely by many companies, including a few large ones. It is gaining market share. Not all AWS services have similar or analogous services in GCP. And vice versa: In particular, GCP offers some more advanced machine learning-based services like the Vision, Speech, and Natural Language APIs. It’s not common to switch once you’re up and running, but it does happen: Spotify migrated from AWS to Google Cloud. There is more discussion on Quora about relative benefits. Of particular note is that VPCs in GCP are global by default with subnetworks per region, while AWS’ VPCs have to live within a particular region. This gives GCP an edge if you’re designing applications with geo-replication from the beginning. It’s also possible to share one GCP VPC between multiple projects (roughly analogous to AWS accounts), while in AWS you’d have to peer them. It’s also possible to peer GCP VPCs in a similar manner to how it’s done in AWS.
Microsoft Azure is the de facto choice for companies and teams that are focused on a Microsoft stack, and it has now placed significant emphasis on Linux as well
In China, AWS’ footprint is relatively small. The market is dominated by Alibaba’s Alibaba Cloud, formerly called Aliyun.
Companies at (very) large scale may want to reduce costs by managing their own infrastructure. For example, Dropbox migrated to their own infrastructure.
Other cloud providers such as Digital Ocean offer similar services, sometimes with greater ease of use, more personalized support, or lower cost. However, none of these match the breadth of products, mind-share, and market domination AWS now enjoys.
Traditional managed hosting providers such as Rackspace offer cloud solutions as well.


🚪AWS vs. PaaS: If your goal is just to put up a single service that does something relatively simple, and you’re trying to minimize time managing operations engineering, consider a platform-as-a-service such as Heroku. The AWS approach to PaaS, Elastic Beanstalk, is arguably more complex, especially for simple use cases.
🚪AWS vs. web hosting: If your main goal is to host a website or blog, and you don’t expect to be building an app or more complex service, you may wish consider one of the myriad web hosting services.
🚪AWS vs. managed hosting: Traditionally, many companies pay managed hosting providers to maintain physical servers for them, then build and deploy their software on top of the rented hardware. This makes sense for businesses who want direct control over hardware, due to legacy, performance, or special compliance constraints, but is usually considered old fashioned or unnecessary by many developer-centric startups and younger tech companies.
Complexity: AWS will let you build and scale systems to the size of the largest companies, but the complexity of the services when used at scale requires significant depth of knowledge and experience. Even very simple use cases often require more knowledge to do “right” in AWS than in a simpler environment like Heroku or Digital Ocean. (This guide may help!)
Geographic locations: AWS has data centers in over a dozen geographic locations, known as regions, in Europe, East Asia, North and South America, and now Australia and India. It also has many more edge locations globally for reduced latency of services like CloudFront.

See the current list of regions and edge locations, including upcoming ones.
If your infrastructure needs to be in close physical proximity to another service for latency or throughput reasons (for example, latency to an ad exchange), viability of AWS may depend on the location.


⛓Lock-in: As you use AWS, it’s important to be aware when you are depending on AWS services that do not have equivalents elsewhere.

Lock-in may be completely fine for your company, or a significant risk. It’s important from a business perspective to make this choice explicitly, and consider the cost, operational, business continuity, and competitive risks of being tied to AWS. AWS is such a dominant and reliable vendor, many companies are comfortable with using AWS to its full extent. Others can tell stories about the dangers of “cloud jail” when costs spiral.
Generally, the more AWS services you use, the more lock-in you have to AWS — that is, the more engineering resources (time and money) it will take to change to other providers in the future.
Basic services like virtual servers and standard databases are usually easy to migrate to other providers or on premises. Others like load balancers and IAM are specific to AWS but have close equivalents from other providers. The key thing to consider is whether engineers are architecting systems around specific AWS services that are not open source or relatively interchangeable. For example, Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis, Redshift, and DynamoDB do not have substantially equivalent open source or commercial service equivalents, while EC2, RDS (MySQL or Postgres), EMR, and ElastiCache more or less do. (See more below, where these are noted with ⛓.)


Combining AWS and other cloud providers: Many customers combine AWS with other non-AWS services. For example, legacy systems or secure data might be in a managed hosting provider, while other systems are AWS. Or a company might only use S3 with another provider doing everything else. However small startups or projects starting fresh will typically stick to AWS or Google Cloud only.
Hybrid cloud: In larger enterprises, it is common to have hybrid deployments encompassing private cloud or on-premises servers and AWS — or other enterprise cloud providers like IBM/Bluemix, Microsoft/Azure, NetApp, or EMC.
Major customers: Who uses AWS and Google Cloud?

AWS’s list of customers includes large numbers of mainstream online properties and major brands, such as Netflix, Pinterest, Spotify (moving to Google Cloud), Airbnb, Expedia, Yelp, Zynga, Comcast, Nokia, and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Azure’s list of customers includes companies such as NBC Universal, 3M and Honeywell Inc.
Google Cloud’s list of customers is large as well, and includes a few mainstream sites, such as Snapchat, Best Buy, Domino’s, and Sony Music.



Which Services to Use

AWS offers a lot of different services — about a hundred at last count.
Most customers use a few services heavily, a few services lightly, and the rest not at all. What services you’ll use depends on your use cases. Choices differ substantially from company to company.
Immature and unpopular services: Just because AWS has a service that sounds promising, it doesn’t mean you should use it. Some services are very narrow in use case, not mature, are overly opinionated, or have limitations, so building your own solution may be better. We try to give a sense for this by breaking products into categories.
Must-know infrastructure: Most typical small to medium-size users will focus on the following services first. If you manage use of AWS systems, you likely need to know at least a little about all of these. (Even if you don’t use them, you should learn enough to make that choice intelligently.)

IAM: User accounts and identities (you need to think about accounts early on!)
EC2: Virtual servers and associated components, including:

AMIs: Machine Images
Load Balancers: CLBs and ALBs
Autoscaling: Capacity scaling (adding and removing servers based on load)
EBS: Network-attached disks
Elastic IPs: Assigned IP addresses


S3: Storage of files
Route 53: DNS and domain registration
VPC: Virtual networking, network security, and co-location; you automatically use
CloudFront: CDN for hosting content
CloudWatch: Alerts, paging, monitoring


Managed services: Existing software solutions you could run on your own, but with managed deployment:

RDS: Managed relational databases (managed MySQL, Postgres, and Amazon’s own Aurora database)
EMR: Managed Hadoop
Elasticsearch: Managed Elasticsearch
ElastiCache: Managed Redis and Memcached


Optional but important infrastructure: These are key and useful infrastructure components that are less widely known and used. You may have legitimate reasons to prefer alternatives, so evaluate with care to be sure they fit your needs:

⛓Lambda: Running small, fully managed tasks “serverless”
CloudTrail: AWS API logging and audit (often neglected but important)
⛓🕍CloudFormation: Templatized configuration of collections of AWS resources
🕍Elastic Beanstalk: Fully managed (PaaS) deployment of packaged Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker applications
🐥EFS: Network filesystem compatible with NFSv4.1
⛓🕍ECS: Docker container/cluster management (note Docker can also be used directly, without ECS)
🕍 EKS: Kubernetes (K8) Docker Container/Cluster management
⛓ECR: Hosted private Docker registry
🐥Config: AWS configuration inventory, history, change notifications
🐥X-Ray: Trace analysis and debugging for distributed applications such as microservices.


Special-purpose infrastructure: These services are focused on specific use cases and should be evaluated if they apply to your situation. Many also are proprietary architectures, so tend to tie you to AWS.

⛓DynamoDB: Low-latency NoSQL key-value store
⛓Glacier: Slow and cheap alternative to S3
⛓Kinesis: Streaming (distributed log) service
⛓SQS: Message queueing service
⛓Redshift: Data warehouse
🐥QuickSight: Business intelligence service
SES: Send and receive e-mail for marketing or transactions
⛓API Gateway: Proxy, manage, and secure API calls
⛓IoT: Manage bidirectional communication over HTTP, WebSockets, and MQTT between AWS and clients (often but not necessarily “things” like appliances or sensors)
⛓WAF: Web firewall for CloudFront to deflect attacks
⛓KMS: Store and manage encryption keys securely
Inspector: Security audit
Trusted Advisor: Automated tips on reducing cost or making improvements
🐥Certificate Manager: Manage SSL/TLS certificates for AWS services
🐥⛓Fargate: Docker containers management, backend for ECS and EKS


Compound services: These are similarly specific, but are full-blown services that tackle complex problems and may tie you in. Usefulness depends on your requirements. If you have large or significant need, you may have these already managed by in-house systems and engineering teams.

Machine Learning: Machine learning model training and classification
Lex: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU)
Polly: Text-to-speech engine in the cloud
Rekognition: Service for image recognition
⛓🕍Data Pipeline: Managed ETL service
⛓🕍SWF: Managed state tracker for distributed polyglot job workflow
⛓🕍Lumberyard: 3D game engine


Mobile/app development:

SNS: Manage app push notifications and other end-user notifications
⛓🕍Cognito: User authentication via Facebook, Twitter, etc.
Device Farm: Cloud-based device testing
Mobile Analytics: Analytics solution for app usage
🕍Mobile Hub: Comprehensive, managed mobile app framework


Enterprise services: These are relevant if you have significant corporate cloud-based or hybrid needs. Many smaller companies and startups use other solutions, like Google Apps or Box. Larger companies may also have their own non-AWS IT solutions.

AppStream: Windows apps in the cloud, with access from many devices
Workspaces: Windows desktop in the cloud, with access from many devices
WorkDocs (formerly Zocalo): Enterprise document sharing
WorkMail: Enterprise managed e-mail and calendaring service
Directory Service: Microsoft Active Directory in the cloud
Direct Connect: Dedicated network connection between office or data center and AWS
Storage Gateway: Bridge between on-premises IT and cloud storage
Service Catalog: IT service approval and compliance


Probably-don't-need-to-know services: Bottom line, our informal polling indicates these services are just not broadly used — and often for good reasons:

Snowball: If you want to ship petabytes of data into or out of Amazon using a physical appliance, read on.
Snowmobile: Appliances are great, but if you've got exabyte scale data to get into Amazon, nothing beats a tractor trailer full of drives.
CodeCommit: Git service. You’re probably already using GitHub or your own solution (Stackshare has informal stats).
🕍CodePipeline: Continuous integration. You likely have another solution already.
🕍CodeDeploy: Deployment of code to EC2 servers. Again, you likely have another solution.
🕍OpsWorks: Management of your deployments using Chef or (as of November 2017) Puppet Enterprise.


AWS in Plain English offers more friendly explanation of what all the other different services are.

Tools and Services Market Landscape
There are now enough cloud and “big data” enterprise companies and products that few can keep up with the market landscape. (See the Big Data Evolving Landscape – 2016 for one attempt at this.)
We’ve assembled a landscape of a few of the services. This is far from complete, but tries to emphasize services that are popular with AWS practitioners — services that specifically help with AWS, or a complementary, or tools almost anyone using AWS must learn.

Common Concepts

📒 The AWS General Reference covers a bunch of common concepts that are relevant for multiple services.
AWS allows deployments in regions, which are isolated geographic locations that help you reduce latency or offer additional redundancy. Regions contain availability zones(AZs), which are typically the first tool of choice for high availability). AZs are physically separate from one another even within the same region, and may span multiple physical data centers. While they are connected via low latency links, natural disasters afflicting one should not affect others.
Each service has API endpoints for each region. Endpoints differ from service to service and not all services are available in each region, as listed in these tables.
Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) are specially formatted identifiers for identifying resources. They start with 'arn:' and are used in many services, and in particular for IAM policies.

Service Matrix
Many services within AWS can at least be compared with Google Cloud offerings or with internal Google services. And often times you could assemble the same thing yourself with open source software. This table is an effort at listing these rough correspondences. (Remember that this table is imperfect as in almost every case there are subtle differences of features!)

Compliance

Many applications have strict requirements around reliability, security, or data privacy. The AWS Compliance page has details about AWS’s certifications, which include PCI DSS Level 1, SOC 1,2, and 3, HIPAA, and ISO 9001.
Security in the cloud is a complex topic, based on a shared responsibility model, where some elements of compliance are provided by AWS, and some are provided by your company.
Several third-party vendors offer assistance with compliance, security, and auditing on AWS. If you have substantial needs in these areas, assistance is a good idea.
From inside China, AWS services outside China are generally accessible, though there are at times breakages in service. There are also AWS services inside China.

Getting Help and Support

Forums: For many problems, it’s worth searching or asking for help in the discussion forums to see if it’s a known issue.
Premium support: AWS offers several levels of premium support.

The first tier, called ""Developer support"" lets you file support tickets with 12 to 24 hour turnaround time, it starts at $29 but once your monthly spend reaches around $1000 it changes to a 3% surcharge on your bill.
The higher-level support services are quite expensive — and increase your bill by up to 10%. Many large and effective companies never pay for this level of support. They are usually more helpful for midsize or larger companies needing rapid turnaround on deeper or more perplexing problems.
Keep in mind, a flexible architecture can reduce need for support. You shouldn’t be relying on AWS to solve your problems often. For example, if you can easily re-provision a new server, it may not be urgent to solve a rare kernel-level issue unique to one EC2 instance. If your EBS volumes have recent snapshots, you may be able to restore a volume before support can rectify the issue with the old volume. If your services have an issue in one availability zone, you should in any case be able to rely on a redundant zone or migrate services to another zone.
Larger customers also get access to AWS Enterprise support, with dedicated technical account managers (TAMs) and shorter response time SLAs.
There is definitely some controversy about how useful the paid support is. The support staff don’t always seem to have the information and authority to solve the problems that are brought to their attention. Often your ability to have a problem solved may depend on your relationship with your account rep.


Account manager: If you are at significant levels of spend (thousands of US dollars plus per month), you may be assigned (or may wish to ask for) a dedicated account manager.

These are a great resource, even if you’re not paying for premium support. Build a good relationship with them and make use of them, for questions, problems, and guidance.
Assign a single point of contact on your company’s side, to avoid confusing or overwhelming them.


Contact: The main web contact point for AWS is here. Many technical requests can be made via these channels.
Consulting and managed services: For more hands-on assistance, AWS has established relationships with many consulting partners and managed service partners. The big consultants won’t be cheap, but depending on your needs, may save you costs long term by helping you set up your architecture more effectively, or offering specific expertise, e.g. security. Managed service providers provide longer-term full-service management of cloud resources.
AWS Professional Services: AWS provides consulting services alone or in combination with partners.

Restrictions and Other Notes

🔸Lots of resources in Amazon have limits on them. This is actually helpful, so you don’t incur large costs accidentally. You have to request that quotas be increased by opening support tickets. Some limits are easy to raise, and some are not. (Some of these are noted in sections below.) Additionally, not all service limits are published.

Obtaining Current Limits and Usage: Limit information for a service may be available from the service API, Trusted Advisor, both or neither (in which case you'll need to contact Support). This page from the awslimitchecker tool's documentation provides a nice summary of available retrieval options for each limit. The tool itself is also valuable for automating limit checks.


🔸AWS terms of service are extensive. Much is expected boilerplate, but it does contain important notes and restrictions on each service. In particular, there are restrictions against using many AWS services in safety-critical systems. (Those appreciative of legal humor may wish to review clause 57.10.)

Getting certified: If you’re interested in studying for and getting certifications, this practical overview tells you a lot of what you need to know. The official page is here and there is an FAQ.


Do you need a certification? Especially in consulting companies or when working in key tech roles in large non-tech companies, certifications are important credentials. In others, including in many tech companies and startups, certifications are not common or considered necessary. (In fact, fairly or not, some Silicon Valley hiring managers and engineers see them as a “negative” signal on a resume.)


Managing AWS
Managing Infrastructure State and Change
A great challenge in using AWS to build complex systems (and with DevOps in general) is to manage infrastructure state effectively over time. In general, this boils down to three broad goals for the state of your infrastructure:

Visibility: Do you know the state of your infrastructure (what services you are using, and exactly how)? Do you also know when you — and anyone on your team — make changes? Can you detect misconfigurations, problems, and incidents with your service?
Automation: Can you reconfigure your infrastructure to reproduce past configurations or scale up existing ones without a lot of extra manual work, or requiring knowledge that’s only in someone’s head? Can you respond to incidents easily or automatically?
Flexibility: Can you improve your configurations and scale up in new ways without significant effort? Can you add more complexity using the same tools? Do you share, review, and improve your configurations within your team?

Much of what we discuss below is really about how to improve the answers to these questions.
There are several approaches to deploying infrastructure with AWS, from the console to complex automation tools, to third-party services, all of which attempt to help achieve visibility, automation, and flexibility.
AWS Configuration Management
The first way most people experiment with AWS is via its web interface, the AWS Console. But using the Console is a highly manual process, and often works against automation or flexibility.
So if you’re not going to manage your AWS configurations manually, what should you do? Sadly, there are no simple, universal answers — each approach has pros and cons, and the approaches taken by different companies vary widely, and include directly using APIs (and building tooling on top yourself), using command-line tools, and using third-party tools and services.
AWS Console

The AWS Console lets you control much (but not all) functionality of AWS via a web interface.
Ideally, you should only use the AWS Console in a few specific situations:

It’s great for read-only usage. If you’re trying to understand the state of your system, logging in and browsing it is very helpful.
It is also reasonably workable for very small systems and teams (for example, one engineer setting up one server that doesn’t change often).
It can be useful for operations you’re only going to do rarely, like less than once a month (for example, a one-time VPC setup you probably won’t revisit for a year). In this case using the console can be the simplest approach.


❗Think before you use the console: The AWS Console is convenient, but also the enemy of automation, reproducibility, and team communication. If you’re likely to be making the same change multiple times, avoid the console. Favor some sort of automation, or at least have a path toward automation, as discussed next. Not only does using the console preclude automation, which wastes time later, but it prevents documentation, clarity, and standardization around processes for yourself and your team.

Command-Line tools

The aws command-line interface (CLI), used via the aws command, is the most basic way to save and automate AWS operations.
Don’t underestimate its power. It also has the advantage of being well-maintained — it covers a large proportion of all AWS services, and is up to date.
In general, whenever you can, prefer the command line to the AWS Console for performing operations.
🔹Even in the absence of fancier tools, you can write simple Bash scripts that invoke aws with specific arguments, and check these into Git. This is a primitive but effective way to document operations you’ve performed. It improves automation, allows code review and sharing on a team, and gives others a starting point for future work.
🔹For use that is primarily interactive (not scripted), consider instead using the aws-shell tool from AWS. It is easier to use, with auto-completion and a colorful UI, but still works on the command line. If you’re using SAWS, a previous version of the program, you should migrate to aws-shell.

APIs and SDKs

SDKs for using AWS APIs are available in most major languages, with Go, iOS, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP being most heavily used. AWS maintains a short list, but the awesome-aws list is the most comprehensive and current. Note support for C++ is still new.
Retry logic: An important aspect to consider whenever using SDKs is error handling; under heavy use, a wide variety of failures, from programming errors to throttling to AWS-related outages or failures, can be expected to occur. SDKs typically implement exponential backoff to address this, but this may need to be understood and adjusted over time for some applications. For example, it is often helpful to alert on some error codes and not on others.
❗Don’t use APIs directly. Although AWS documentation includes lots of API details, it’s better to use the SDKs for your preferred language to access APIs. SDKs are more mature, robust, and well-maintained than something you’d write yourself.

Boto

A good way to automate operations in a custom way is Boto3, also known as the Amazon SDK for Python. Boto2, the previous version of this library, has been in wide use for years, but now there is a newer version with official support from Amazon, so prefer Boto3 for new projects.
Boto3 contains a variety of APIs that operate at either a high level or a low level, here some explanation of both:

The low level APIs (Client APIs) are mapped to AWS Cloud service-specific APIs, and all service operations are supported by clients. Clients are generated from a JSON service definition file.
The high level option, Resource APIs, allows you to avoid calling the network at the low level and instead provide an object-oriented way to interact with AWS Cloud services.


Boto3 has a lot of helpful features like waiters, which provide a structure that allows for code to wait for changes to occur in the cloud, for example, when you are creating an EC2 instance and need wait until the instance is running in order to perform another task.
If you find yourself writing a Bash script with more than one or two CLI commands, you’re probably doing it wrong. Stop, and consider writing a Boto script instead. This has the advantages that you can:

Check return codes easily so success of each step depends on success of past steps.
Grab interesting bits of data from responses, like instance ids or DNS names.
Add useful environment information (for example, tag your instances with git revisions, or inject the latest build identifier into your initialization script).



General Visibility

🔹Tagging resources is an essential practice, especially as organizations grow, to better understand your resource usage. For example, through automation or convention, you can add tags:

For the org or developer that “owns” that resource
For the product that resource supports
To label lifecycles, such as temporary resources or one that should be deprovisioned in the future
To distinguish production-critical infrastructure (e.g. serving systems vs backend pipelines)
To distinguish resources with special security or compliance requirements
To (once enabled) allocate cost. Note that cost allocation tags only apply on a forward-looking basis; you can't retroactively apply them to items already billed.
For many years, there was a notorious 10 tag limit per resource, which could not be raised and caused many companies significant pain. As of 2016, this was raised to 50 tags per resource.
🔹In 2017, AWS introduced the ability to enforce tagging on instance and volume creation, deprecating portions of third party tools such as Cloud Custodian.
🔸 Tags are case sensitive; 'environment' and 'Environment' are two different tags. Automation in setting tags is likely the only sensible option at significant scale.
🔸 There is a bug in the ASG console where spaces after tag names are preserved. So if you type ""Name "" with a space at the end you will not get the expected behavior. This is probably true in other locations and SDKs also. Be sure you do not add trailing spaces to tag keys unless you really mean it. (As of Jul 2018)



Managing Servers and Applications
AWS vs Server Configuration
This guide is about AWS, not DevOps or server configuration management in general. But before getting into AWS in detail, it’s worth noting that in addition to the configuration management for your AWS resources, there is the long-standing problem of configuration management for servers themselves.
Philosophy

Heroku’s Twelve-Factor App principles list some established general best practices for deploying applications.
Pets vs cattle: Treat servers like cattle, not pets. That is, design systems so infrastructure is disposable. It should be minimally worrisome if a server is unexpectedly destroyed.
The concept of immutable infrastructure is an extension of this idea.
Minimize application state on EC2 instances. In general, instances should be able to be killed or die unexpectedly with minimal impact. State that is in your application should quickly move to RDS, S3, DynamoDB, EFS, or other data stores not on that instance. EBS is also an option, though it generally should not be the bootable volume, and EBS will require manual or automated re-mounting.

Server Configuration Management

There is a large set of open source tools for managing configuration of server instances.
These are generally not dependent on any particular cloud infrastructure, and work with any variety of Linux (or in many cases, a variety of operating systems).
Leading configuration management tools are Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Saltstack. These aren’t the focus of this guide, but we may mention them as they relate to AWS.

Containers and AWS

Docker and the containerization trend are changing the way many servers and services are deployed in general.
Containers are designed as a way to package up your application(s) and all of their dependencies in a known way. When you build a container, you are including every library or binary your application needs, outside of the kernel. A big advantage of this approach is that it’s easy to test and validate a container locally without worrying about some difference between your computer and the servers you deploy on.
A consequence of this is that you need fewer AMIs and boot scripts; for most deployments, the only boot script you need is a template that fetches an exported docker image and runs it.
Companies that are embracing microservice architectures will often turn to container-based deployments.
AWS launched ECS as a service to manage clusters via Docker in late 2014, though many people still deploy Docker directly themselves. See the ECS section for more details.
AWS launched EKS as a service to manage Kubernetes Clusters mid 2018, though many people still deploy ECS or use Docker directly themselves. See the EKS section for more details.

Visibility

Store and track instance metadata (such as instance id, availability zone, etc.) and deployment info (application build id, Git revision, etc.) in your logs or reports. The instance metadata service can help collect some of the AWS data you’ll need.
Use log management services: Be sure to set up a way to view and manage logs externally from servers.

Cloud-based services such as Sumo Logic, Splunk Cloud, Scalyr, LogDNA, and Loggly are the easiest to set up and use (and also the most expensive, which may be a factor depending on how much log data you have).
Major open source alternatives include Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (the “Elastic Stack”) and Graylog.
If you can afford it (you have little data or lots of money) and don’t have special needs, it makes sense to use hosted services whenever possible, since setting up your own scalable log processing systems is notoriously time consuming.


Track and graph metrics: The AWS Console can show you simple graphs from CloudWatch, you typically will want to track and graph many kinds of metrics, from CloudWatch and your applications. Collect and export helpful metrics everywhere you can (and as long as volume is manageable enough you can afford it).

Services like Librato, KeenIO, and Datadog have fancier features or better user interfaces that can save a lot of time. (A more detailed comparison is here.)
Use Prometheus or Graphite as timeseries databases for your metrics (both are open source).
Grafana can visualize with dashboards the stored metrics of both timeseries databases (also open source).



Tips for Managing Servers

❗Timezone settings on servers: unless absolutely necessary, always set the timezone on servers to UTC (see instructions for your distribution, such as Ubuntu, CentOS or Amazon Linux). Numerous distributed systems rely on time for synchronization and coordination and UTC provides the universal reference plane: it is not subject to  daylight savings changes and adjustments in local time. It will also save you a lot of headache debugging elusive timezone issues and provide coherent timeline of events in your logging and audit systems.
NTP and accurate time: If you are not using Amazon Linux (which comes preconfigured), you should confirm your servers configure NTP correctly, to avoid insidious time drift (which can then cause all sorts of issues, from breaking API calls to misleading logs). This should be part of your automatic configuration for every server. If time has already drifted substantially (generally >1000 seconds), remember NTP won’t shift it back, so you may need to remediate manually (for example, like this on Ubuntu).
Testing immutable infrastructure: If you want to be proactive about testing your service’s ability to cope with instance termination or failure, it can be helpful to introduce random instance termination during business hours, which will expose any such issues at a time when engineers are available to identify and fix them. Netflix’s Simian Army (specifically, Chaos Monkey) is a popular tool for this. Alternatively, chaos-lambda by the BBC is a lightweight option which runs on AWS Lambda.

Security and IAM
We cover security basics first, since configuring user accounts is something you usually have to do early on when setting up your system.
Security and IAM Basics

📒 IAM Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ
The AWS Security Blog is one of the best sources of news and information on AWS security.
IAM is the service you use to manage accounts and permissioning for AWS.
Managing security and access control with AWS is critical, so every AWS administrator needs to use and understand IAM, at least at a basic level.
IAM identities include users (people or services that are using AWS), groups (containers for sets of users and their permissions), and roles (containers for permissions assigned to AWS service instances). Permissions for these identities are governed by policies You can use AWS pre-defined policies or custom policies that you create.
IAM manages various kinds of authentication, for both users and for software services that may need to authenticate with AWS, including:

Passwords to log into the console. These are a username and password for real users.
Access keys, which you may use with command-line tools. These are two strings, one the “id”, which is an upper-case alphabetic string of the form 'AXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', and the other is the secret, which is a 40-character mixed-case base64-style string. These are often set up for services, not just users.

📜 Access keys that start with AKIA are normal keys. Access keys that start with ASIA are session/temporary keys from STS, and will require an additional ""SessionToken"" parameter to be sent along with the id and secret. See the documentation for a complete list of access key prefixes.


Multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is the highly recommended practice of using a keychain fob or smartphone app as a second layer of protection for user authentication.


IAM allows complex and fine-grained control of permissions, dividing users into groups, assigning permissions to roles, and so on. There is a policy language that can be used to customize security policies in a fine-grained way.

An excellent high level overview of IAM policy concepts lives at IAM Policies In A Nutshell.
🔸The policy language has a complex and error-prone JSON syntax that’s quite confusing, so unless you are an expert, it is wise to base yours off trusted examples or AWS’ own pre-defined managed policies.


At the beginning, IAM policy may be very simple, but for large systems, it will grow in complexity, and need to be managed with care.

🔹Make sure one person (perhaps with a backup) in your organization is formally assigned ownership of managing IAM policies, make sure every administrator works with that person to have changes reviewed. This goes a long way to avoiding accidental and serious misconfigurations.


It is best to give each user or service the minimum privileges needed to perform their duties. This is the principle of least privilege, one of the foundations of good security. Organize all IAM users and groups according to levels of access they need.
IAM has the permission hierarchy of:

Explicit deny: The most restrictive policy wins.
Explicit allow: Access permissions to any resource has to be explicitly given.
Implicit deny: All permissions are implicitly denied by default.


You can test policy permissions via the AWS IAM policy simulator tool tool. This is particularly useful if you write custom policies.

Security and IAM Tips

🔹Use IAM to create individual user accounts and use IAM accounts for all users from the beginning. This is slightly more work, but not that much.

That way, you define different users, and groups with different levels of privilege (if you want, choose from Amazon’s default suggestions, of administrator, power user, etc.).
This allows credential revocation, which is critical in some situations. If an employee leaves, or a key is compromised, you can revoke credentials with little effort.
You can set up Active Directory federation to use organizational accounts in AWS.


❗Enable MFA on your account.

You should always use MFA, and the sooner the better — enabling it when you already have many users is extra work.
Unfortunately it can’t be enforced in software, so an administrative policy has to be established.
Most users can use the Google Authenticator app (on iOS or Android) to support two-factor authentication. For the root account, consider a hardware fob.


❗Restrict use of significant IAM credentials as much as possible. Remember that in the cloud, loss of a highly capable IAM credential could essentially mean “game over,” for your deployment, your users, or your whole company.

Do NOT use the Root User account other than when you initially create your account.  Create custom IAM users and/or roles and use those for your applications instead.

Lock up access and use of the root credentials as much as possible. Ideally they should be effectively “offline.” For critical deployments, this means attached to an actual MFA device, physically secured and rarely used.




❗Turn on CloudTrail: One of the first things you should do is enable CloudTrail. Even if you are not a security hawk, there is little reason not to do this from the beginning, so you have data on what has been happening in your AWS account should you need that information. You’ll likely also want to set up a log management service to search and access these logs.
🔹Use IAM roles for EC2: Rather than assign IAM users to applications like services and then sharing the sensitive credentials, define and assign roles to EC2 instances and have applications retrieve credentials from the instance metadata.
Assign IAM roles by realm — for example, to development, staging, and production. If you’re setting up a role, it should be tied to a specific realm so you have clean separation. This prevents, for example, a development instance from connecting to a production database.
Best practices: AWS’ list of best practices is worth reading in full up front.
IAM Reference: This interactive reference for all IAM actions, effects, and resources is great to have open while writing new or trying to understand existing IAM policies.
Multiple accounts: Decide on whether you want to use multiple AWS accounts and research how to organize access across them. Factors to consider:

Number of users
Importance of isolation

Resource Limits
Permission granularity
Security
API Limits


Regulatory issues
Workload
Size of infrastructure
Cost of multi-account “overhead”: Internal AWS service management tools may need to be custom built or adapted.
🔹It can help to use separate AWS accounts for independent parts of your infrastructure if you expect a high rate of AWS API calls, since AWS throttles calls at the AWS account level.


Inspector is an automated security assessment service from AWS that helps identify common security risks. This allows validation that you adhere to certain security practices and may help with compliance.
Trusted Advisor addresses a variety of best practices, but also offers some basic security checks around IAM usage, security group configurations, and MFA. At paid support tiers, Trusted Advisor exposes additional checks around other areas, such as reserved instance optimization.
Use KMS for managing keys: AWS offers KMS for securely managing encryption keys, which is usually a far better option than handling key security yourself. See below.
AWS WAF is a web application firewall to help you protect your applications from common attack patterns.
Security auditing:

Security Monkey is an open source tool that is designed to assist with security audits.
Scout2 is an open source tool that uses AWS APIs to assess an environment’s security posture. Scout2 is stable and actively maintained.
🔹Export and audit security settings: You can audit security policies simply by exporting settings using AWS APIs, e.g. using a Boto script like SecConfig.py (from this 2013 talk) and then reviewing and monitoring changes manually or automatically.



Security and IAM Gotchas and Limitations

❗Don’t share user credentials: It’s remarkably common for first-time AWS users to create one account and one set of credentials (access key or password), and then use them for a while, sharing among engineers and others within a company. This is easy. But don’t do this. This is an insecure practice for many reasons, but in particular, if you do, you will have reduced ability to revoke credentials on a per-user or per-service basis (for example, if an employee leaves or a key is compromised), which can lead to serious complications.
❗Instance metadata throttling: The instance metadata service has rate limiting on API calls. If you deploy IAM roles widely (as you should!) and have lots of services, you may hit global account limits easily.

One solution is to have code or scripts cache and reuse the credentials locally for a short period (say 2 minutes). For example, they can be put into the ~/.aws/credentials file but must also be refreshed automatically.
But be careful not to cache credentials for too long, as they expire. (Note the other dynamic metadata also changes over time and should not be cached a long time, either.)


🔸Some IAM operations are slower than other API calls (many seconds), since AWS needs to propagate these globally across regions.
❗The uptime of IAM’s API has historically been lower than that of the instance metadata API. Be wary of incorporating a dependency on IAM’s API into critical paths or subsystems — for example, if you validate a user’s IAM group membership when they log into an instance and aren’t careful about precaching group membership or maintaining a back door, you might end up locking users out altogether when the API isn’t available.
❗Don't check in AWS credentials or secrets to a git repository. There are bots that scan GitHub looking for credentials. Use scripts or tools, such as git-secrets to prevent anyone on your team from checking in sensitive information to your git repositories.

S3
S3 Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
S3 (Simple Storage Service) is AWS’ standard cloud storage service, offering file (opaque “blob”) storage of arbitrary numbers of files of almost any size, from 0 to 5TB. (Prior to 2011 the maximum size was 5 GB; larger sizes are now well supported via multipart support.)
Items, or objects, are placed into named buckets stored with names which are usually called keys. The main content is the value.
Objects are created, deleted, or updated. Large objects can be streamed, but you cannot modify parts of a value; you need to update the whole object. Partial data access can work via S3 Select.
Every object also has metadata, which includes arbitrary key-value pairs, and is used in a way similar to HTTP headers. Some metadata is system-defined, some are significant when serving HTTP content from buckets or CloudFront, and you can also define arbitrary metadata for your own use.
S3 URIs: Although often bucket and key names are provided in APIs individually, it’s also common practice to write an S3 location in the form 's3://bucket-name/path/to/key' (where the key here is 'path/to/key'). (You’ll also see 's3n://' and 's3a://' prefixes in Hadoop systems.)
S3 vs Glacier, EBS, and EFS: AWS offers many storage services, and several besides S3 offer file-type abstractions. Glacier is for cheaper and infrequently accessed archival storage. EBS, unlike S3, allows random access to file contents via a traditional filesystem, but can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time. EFS is a network filesystem many instances can connect to, but at higher cost. See the comparison table.

S3 Tips

For most practical purposes, you can consider S3 capacity unlimited, both in total size of files and number of objects. The number of objects in a bucket is essentially also unlimited. Customers routinely have millions of objects.
❗Permissions:

🔸If you're storing business data on Amazon S3, it’s important to manage permissions sensibly. In 2017 companies like Dow Jones and Verizon saw data breaches due to poorly-chosen S3 configuration for sensitive data. Fixing this later can be a difficult task if you have a lot of assets and internal users.
🔸There are 3 different ways to grant permissions to access Amazon S3 content in your buckets.

IAM policies use the familiar Identity and Authentication Management permission scheme to control access to specific operations.
Bucket policies grant or deny permissions to an entire bucket. You might use this when hosting a website in S3, to make the bucket publicly readable, or to restrict access to a bucket by IP address. Amazon's sample bucket policies show a number of use cases where these policies come in handy.
Access Control Lists (ACLs) can also be applied to every bucket and object stored in S3. ACLs grant additional permissions beyond those specified in IAM or bucket policies. ACLs can be used to grant access to another AWS user, or to predefined groups like the general public. This is powerful but can be dangerous, because you need to inspect every object to see who has access.


🔸AWS' predefined access control groups allow access that may not be what you'd expect from their names:

""All Users"", or ""Everyone"", grants permission to the general public, not only to users defined in your own AWS account. If an object is available to All Users, then it can be retrieved with a simple HTTP request of the form http://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/filename. No authorization or signature is required to access data in this category.
""Authenticated Users"" grants permissions to anyone with an AWS account, again not limited to your own users. Because anyone can sign up for AWS, for all intents and purposes this is also open to the general public.
""Log Delivery"" group is used by AWS to write logs to buckets and should be safe to enable on the buckets that need it.
A typical use case of this ACL is used in conjunction with the requester pays functionality of S3.


❗ Bucket permissions and object permissions are two different things and independent of each other. A private object in a public bucket can be seen when listing the bucket, but not downloaded. At the same time, a public object in a private bucket won't be seen because the bucket contents can't be listed, but can still be downloaded by anyone who knows its exact key. Users that don't have access to set bucket permissions can still make objects public if they have s3:PutObjectAcl or s3:PutObjectVersionAcl permissions.
🐥In August 2017, AWS added AWS Config rules to ensure your S3 buckets are secure.

❗These AWS Config rules only check the security of your bucket policy and bucket-level ACLs. You can still create object ACLs that grant additional permissions, including opening files to the whole world.


🔹Do create new buckets if you have different types of data with different sensitivity levels. This is much less error prone than complex permissions rules. For example, if data is for administrators only, like log data, put it in a new bucket that only administrators can access.
For more guidance, see:

How to Secure an Amazon S3 Bucket
Deep dive into S3 access controls.
How do S3 permissions work?.




Bucket naming: Buckets are chosen from a global namespace (across all regions, even though S3 itself stores data in whichever S3 region you select), so you’ll find many bucket names are already taken. Creating a bucket means taking ownership of the name until you delete it. Bucket names have a few restrictions on them.

Bucket names can be used as part of the hostname when accessing the bucket or its contents, like <bucket_name>.s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com, as long as the name is DNS compliant.
A common practice is to use the company name acronym or abbreviation to prefix (or suffix, if you prefer DNS-style hierarchy) all bucket names (but please, don’t use a check on this as a security measure — this is highly insecure and easily circumvented!).
🔸Bucket names with '.' (periods) in them can cause certificate mismatches when used with SSL. Use '-' instead, since this then conforms with both SSL expectations and is DNS compliant.


Versioning: S3 has optional versioning support, so that all versions of objects are preserved on a bucket. This is mostly useful if you want an archive of changes or the ability to back out mistakes (caution: it lacks the featureset of full version control systems like Git).
Durability: Durability of S3 is extremely high, since internally it keeps several replicas. If you don’t delete it by accident, you can count on S3 not losing your data. (AWS offers the seemingly improbable durability rate of 99.999999999%, but this is a mathematical calculation based on independent failure rates and levels of replication — not a true probability estimate. Either way, S3 has had a very good record of durability.) Note this is much higher durability than EBS!
💸S3 pricing depends on storage, requests, and transfer.

For transfer, putting data into AWS is free, but you’ll pay on the way out. Transfer from S3 to EC2 in the same region is free. Transfer to other regions or the Internet in general is not free.
Deletes are free.


S3 Reduced Redundancy and Infrequent Access: Most people use the Standard storage class in S3, but there are other storage classes with lower cost:

🔸Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) has been effectively deprecated, and has lower durability (99.99%, so just four nines) than standard S3. Note that it no longer participates in S3 price reductions, so it offers worse redundancy for more money than standard S3. As a result, there's no reason to use it.
Infrequent Access (IA) lets you get cheaper storage in exchange for more expensive access. This is great for archives like logs you already processed, but might want to look at later. To get an idea of the cost savings when using Infrequent Access (IA), you can use this S3 Infrequent Access Calculator.
Glacier is a third alternative discussed as a separate product.
See the comparison table.


⏱Performance: Maximizing S3 performance means improving overall throughput in terms of bandwidth and number of operations per second.

S3 is highly scalable, so in principle you can get arbitrarily high throughput. (A good example of this is S3DistCp.)
But usually you are constrained by the pipe between the source and S3 and/or the level of concurrency of operations.
Throughput is of course highest from within AWS to S3, and between EC2 instances and S3 buckets that are in the same region.
Bandwidth from EC2 depends on instance type. See the “Network Performance” column at ec2instances.info.
Throughput of many objects is extremely high when data is accessed in a distributed way, from many EC2 instances. It’s possible to read or write objects from S3 from hundreds or thousands of instances at once.
However, throughput is very limited when objects accessed sequentially from a single instance. Individual operations take many milliseconds, and bandwidth to and from instances is limited.
Therefore, to perform large numbers of operations, it’s necessary to use multiple worker threads and connections on individual instances, and for larger jobs, multiple EC2 instances as well.
Multi-part uploads: For large objects you want to take advantage of the multi-part uploading capabilities (starting with minimum chunk sizes of 5 MB).
Large downloads: Also you can download chunks of a single large object in parallel by exploiting the HTTP GET range-header capability.
🔸List pagination: Listing contents happens at 1000 responses per request, so for buckets with many millions of objects listings will take time.
❗Key prefixes: Previously randomness in the beginning of key names was necessary in order to avoid hot spots, but that is no longer necessary as of July, 2018.
For data outside AWS, DirectConnect and S3 Transfer Acceleration can help. For S3 Transfer Acceleration, you pay about the equivalent of 1-2 months of storage for the transfer in either direction for using nearer endpoints.


Command-line applications: There are a few ways to use S3 from the command line:

Originally, s3cmd was the best tool for the job. It’s still used heavily by many.
The regular aws command-line interface now supports S3 well, and is useful for most situations.
s4cmd is a replacement, with greater emphasis on performance via multi-threading, which is helpful for large files and large sets of files, and also offers Unix-like globbing support.


GUI applications: You may prefer a GUI, or wish to support GUI access for less technical users. Some options:

The AWS Console does offer a graphical way to use S3. Use caution telling non-technical people to use it, however, since without tight permissions, it offers access to many other AWS features.
Transmit is a good option on macOS for most use cases.
Cyberduck is a good option on macOS and Windows with support for multipart uploads, ACLs, versioning, lifecycle configuration, storage classes and server side encryption (SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS).


S3 and CloudFront: S3 is tightly integrated with the CloudFront CDN. See the CloudFront section for more information, as well as S3 transfer acceleration.
Static website hosting:

S3 has a static website hosting option that is simply a setting that enables configurable HTTP index and error pages and HTTP redirect support to public content in S3. It’s a simple way to host static assets or a fully static website.
Consider using CloudFront in front of most or all assets:

Like any CDN, CloudFront improves performance significantly.
🔸SSL is only supported on the built-in amazonaws.com domain for S3. S3 supports serving these sites through a custom domain, but not over SSL on a custom domain. However, CloudFront allows you to serve a custom domain over https. Amazon provides free SNI SSL/TLS certificates via Amazon Certificate Manager. SNI does not work on very outdated browsers/operating systems. Alternatively, you can provide your own certificate to use on CloudFront to support all browsers/operating systems for a fee.
🔸If you are including resources across domains, such as fonts inside CSS files, you may need to configure CORS for the bucket serving those resources.
Since pretty much everything is moving to SSL nowadays, and you likely want control over the domain, you probably want to set up CloudFront with your own certificate in front of S3 (and to ignore the AWS example on this as it is non-SSL only).
That said, if you do, you’ll need to think through invalidation or updates on CloudFront. You may wish to include versions or hashes in filenames so invalidation is not necessary.




Data lifecycles:

When managing data, the understanding the lifecycle of the data is as important as understanding the data itself. When putting data into a bucket, think about its lifecycle — its end of life, not just its beginning.
🔹In general, data with different expiration policies should be stored under separate prefixes at the top level. For example, some voluminous logs might need to be deleted automatically monthly, while other data is critical and should never be deleted. Having the former in a separate bucket or at least a separate folder is wise.
🔸Thinking about this up front will save you pain. It’s very hard to clean up large collections of files created by many engineers with varying lifecycles and no coherent organization.
Alternatively you can set a lifecycle policy to archive old data to Glacier. Be careful with archiving large numbers of small objects to Glacier, since it may actually cost more.
There is also a storage class called Infrequent Access that has the same durability as Standard S3, but is discounted per GB. It is suitable for objects that are infrequently accessed.


Data consistency: Understanding data consistency is critical for any use of S3 where there are multiple producers and consumers of data.

Creation and updates to individual objects in S3 are atomic, in that you’ll never upload a new object or change an object and have another client see only part half the change.
The uncertainty lies with when your clients and other clients see updates.
New objects: If you create a new object, you’ll be able to read it instantly, which is called read-after-write consistency.

Well, with the additional caveat that if you do a read on an object before it exists, then create it, you get eventual consistency (not read-after-write).
This does not apply to any list operations; newly created objects are not guaranteed to appear in a list operation right away


Updates to objects: If you overwrite or delete an object, you’re only guaranteed eventual consistency, i.e. the change will happen but you have no guarantee of when.
🔹For many use cases, treating S3 objects as immutable (i.e. deciding by convention they will be created or deleted but not updated) can greatly simplify the code that uses them, avoiding complex state management.
🔹Note that until 2015, 'us-standard' region had had a weaker eventual consistency model, and the other (newer) regions were read-after-write. This was finally corrected — but watch for many old blogs mentioning this!
Slow updates: In practice, “eventual consistency” usually means within seconds, but expect rare cases of minutes or hours.


S3 as a filesystem:

In general S3’s APIs have inherent limitations that make S3 hard to use directly as a POSIX-style filesystem while still preserving S3’s own object format. For example, appending to a file requires rewriting, which cripples performance, and atomic rename of directories, mutual exclusion on opening files, and hardlinks are impossible.
s3fs is a FUSE filesystem that goes ahead and tries anyway, but it has performance limitations and surprises for these reasons.
Riofs (C) and Goofys (Go) are more recent efforts that attempt adopt a different data storage format to address those issues, and so are likely improvements on s3fs.
S3QL (discussion) is a Python implementation that offers data de-duplication, snap-shotting, and encryption, but only one client at a time.
ObjectiveFS (discussion) is a commercial solution that supports filesystem features and concurrent clients.


If you are primarily using a VPC, consider setting up a VPC Endpoint for S3 in order to allow your VPC-hosted resources to easily access it without the need for extra network configuration or hops.
Cross-region replication: S3 has a feature for replicating a bucket between one region and another. Note that S3 is already highly replicated within one region, so usually this isn’t necessary for durability, but it could be useful for compliance (geographically distributed data storage), lower latency, or as a strategy to reduce region-to-region bandwidth costs by mirroring heavily used data in a second region.
IPv4 vs IPv6: For a long time S3 only supported IPv4 at the default endpoint https://BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com. However, as of Aug 11, 2016 it now supports both IPv4 & IPv6! To use both, you have to enable dualstack either in your preferred API client or by directly using this url scheme https://BUCKET.s3.dualstack.REGION.amazonaws.com. This extends to S3 Transfer Acceleration as well.
S3 event notifications: S3 can be configured to send an SNS notification, SQS message, or AWS Lambda function on bucket events.
💸Limit your individual users (or IAM roles) to the minimal required S3 locations, and catalog the “approved” locations. Otherwise, S3 tends to become the dumping ground where people put data to random locations that are not cleaned up for years, costing you big bucks.
If a bucket is deleted in S3, it can take up to 10 hours before a bucket with the same name can be created again. (discussion)

S3 Gotchas and Limitations

❗S3 buckets sit outside the VPC and can be accessed from anywhere in the world if bucket policies are not set to deny it. Read the permissions section above carefully, there are countless cases of buckets exposed to the public.
🔸For many years, there was a notorious 100-bucket limit per account, which could not be raised and caused many companies significant pain. As of 2015, you can request increases. You can ask to increase the limit, but it will still be capped (generally below ~1000 per account).
🔸Be careful not to make implicit assumptions about transactionality or sequencing of updates to objects. Never assume that if you modify a sequence of objects, the clients will see the same modifications in the same sequence, or if you upload a whole bunch of files, that they will all appear at once to all clients.
🔸S3 has an SLA with 99.9% uptime. If you use S3 heavily, you’ll inevitably see occasional error accessing or storing data as disks or other infrastructure fail. Availability is usually restored in seconds or minutes. Although availability is not extremely high, as mentioned above, durability is excellent.
🔸After uploading, any change that you make to the object causes a full rewrite of the object, so avoid appending-like behavior with regular files.
🔸Eventual data consistency, as discussed above, can be surprising sometimes. If S3 suffers from internal replication issues, an object may be visible from a subset of the machines, depending on which S3 endpoint they hit. Those usually resolve within seconds; however, we’ve seen isolated cases when the issue lingered for 20-30 hours.
🔸MD5s and multi-part uploads: In S3, the ETag header in S3 is a hash on the object. And in many cases, it is the MD5 hash. However, this is not the case in general when you use multi-part uploads. One workaround is to compute MD5s yourself and put them in a custom header (such as is done by s4cmd).
🔸Incomplete multi-part upload costs: Incomplete multi-part uploads accrue storage charges even if the upload fails and no S3 object is created. Amazon (and others) recommend using a lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete uploads and save on storage costs. Note that if you have many of these, it may be worth investigating whatever's failing regularly.
🔸US Standard region: Previously, the us-east-1 region (also known as the US Standard region) was replicated across coasts, which led to greater variability of latency. Effective Jun 19, 2015 this is no longer the case. All Amazon S3 regions now support read-after-write consistency. Amazon S3 also renamed the US Standard region to the US East (N. Virginia) region to be consistent with AWS regional naming conventions.
🔸S3 authentication versions and regions: In newer regions, S3 only supports the latest authentication. If an S3 file operation using CLI or SDK doesn't work in one region, but works correctly in another region, make sure you are using the latest authentication signature.

EC2
EC2 Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Documentation ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing (see also ec2instances.info)
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is AWS’ offering of the most fundamental piece of cloud computing: A virtual private server. These “instances” can run most Linux, BSD, and Windows operating systems. Internally, they've used a heavily modified Xen virtualization. That said, new instance classes are being introduced with a KVM derived hypervisor instead, called Nitro. So far, this is limited to the C5 and M5 instance types. Lastly, there's a ""bare metal hypervisor"" available for i3.metal instances
The term “EC2” is sometimes used to refer to the servers themselves, but technically refers more broadly to a whole collection of supporting services, too, like load balancing (CLBs/ALBs/NLBs), IP addresses (EIPs), bootable images (AMIs), security groups, and network drives (EBS) (which we discuss individually in this guide).
💸**EC2 pricing** and cost management is a complicated topic. It can range from free (on the AWS free tier) to a lot, depending on your usage. Pricing is by instance type, by second or hour, and changes depending on AWS region and whether you are purchasing your instances On-Demand, on the Spot market or pre-purchasing (Reserved Instances).
Network Performance: For some instance types, AWS uses general terms like Low, Medium, and High to refer to network performance. Users have done benchmarking to provide expectations for what these terms can mean.

EC2 Alternatives and Lock-In

Running EC2 is akin to running a set of physical servers, as long as you don’t do automatic scaling or tooled cluster setup. If you just run a set of static instances, migrating to another VPS or dedicated server provider should not be too hard.
🚪Alternatives to EC2: The direct alternatives are Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, DigitalOcean, AWS's own Lightsail offering, and other VPS providers, some of which offer similar APIs for setting up and removing instances. (See the comparisons above.)
Should you use Amazon Linux? AWS encourages use of their own Amazon Linux, which is evolved from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS. It’s used by many, but others are skeptical. Whatever you do, think this decision through carefully. It’s true Amazon Linux is heavily tested and better supported in the unlikely event you have deeper issues with OS and virtualization on EC2. But in general, many companies do just fine using a standard, non-Amazon Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu or CentOS. Using a standard Linux distribution means you have an exactly replicable environment should you use another hosting provider instead of (or in addition to) AWS. It’s also helpful if you wish to test deployments on local developer machines running the same standard Linux distribution (a practice that’s getting more common with Docker, too. Amazon now supports an official Amazon Linux Docker image, aimed at assisting with local development on a comparable environment, though this is new enough that it should be considered experimental). Note that the currently-in-testing Amazon Linux 2 supports on-premise deployments explicitly.
EC2 costs: See the section on this.

EC2 Tips


🔹Picking regions: When you first set up, consider which regions you want to use first. Many people in North America just automatically set up in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region, which is the default, but it’s worth considering if this is best up front. You'll want to evaluate service availability (some services are not available in all regions), costing (baseline costs also vary by region by up to 10-30% (generally lowest in us-east-1 for comparison purposes)), and compliance (various countries have differing regulations with regard to data privacy, for example).


Instance types: EC2 instances come in many types, corresponding to the capabilities of the virtual machine in CPU architecture and speed, RAM, disk sizes and types (SSD or magnetic), and network bandwidth.

Selecting instance types is complex since there are so many types. Additionally there are different generations, released over the years.
🔹Use the list at ec2instances.info to review costs and features. Amazon’s own list of instance types is hard to use, and doesn’t list features and price together, which makes it doubly difficult.
Prices vary a lot, so use ec2instances.info to determine the set of machines that meet your needs and ec2price.com to find the cheapest type in the region you’re working in. Depending on the timing and region, it might be much cheaper to rent an instance with more memory or CPU than the bare minimum.



Turn off your instances when they aren’t in use. For many situations such as testing or staging resources, you may not need your instances on 24/7, and you won’t need to pay EC2 running costs when they are suspended. Given that costs are calculated based on usage, this is a simple mechanism for cost savings. This can be achieved using Lambda and CloudWatch, an open source option like cloudcycler, or a SaaS provider like GorillaStack. (Note: if you turn off instances with an ephemeral root volume, any state will be lost when the instance is turned off. Therefore, for stateful applications it is safer to turn off EBS backed instances).


Dedicated instances and dedicated hosts are assigned hardware, instead of usual virtual instances. They are more expensive than virtual instances but can be preferable for performance, compliance, financial modeling, or licensing reasons.


32 bit vs 64 bit: A few micro, small, and medium instances are still available to use as 32-bit architecture. You’ll be using 64-bit EC2 (“amd64”) instances nowadays, though smaller instances still support 32 bit (“i386”). Use 64 bit unless you have legacy constraints or other good reasons to use 32.


HVM vs PV: There are two kinds of virtualization technology used by EC2, hardware virtual machine (HVM) and paravirtual (PV). Historically, PV was the usual type, but now HVM is becoming the standard. If you want to use the newest instance types, you must use HVM. See the instance type matrix for details.


Operating system: To use EC2, you’ll need to pick a base operating system. It can be Windows or Linux, such as Ubuntu or Amazon Linux. You do this with AMIs, which are covered in more detail in their own section below.


Limits: You can’t create arbitrary numbers of instances. Default limits on numbers of EC2 instances per account vary by instance type, as described in this list.


❗Use termination protection: For any instances that are important and long-lived (in particular, aren't part of auto-scaling), enable termination protection. This is an important line of defense against user mistakes, such as accidentally terminating many instances instead of just one due to human error.


SSH key management:

When you start an instance, you need to have at least one ssh key pair set up, to bootstrap, i.e., allow you to ssh in the first time.
Aside from bootstrapping, you should manage keys yourself on the instances, assigning individual keys to individual users or services as appropriate.
Avoid reusing the original boot keys except by administrators when creating new instances.
Avoid sharing keys and add individual ssh keys for individual users.



GPU support: You can rent GPU-enabled instances on EC2 for use in machine learning or graphics rendering workloads.

There are three types of GPU-enabled instances currently available:

The P3 series offers NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs in 1, 4 and 8 GPU configurations targeting machine learning, scientific workloads, and other high performance computign applications.
The P2 series offers NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs in 1, 8 and 16 GPU configurations targeting machine learning, scientific workloads, and other high performance computign applications.
The G3 series offers NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs in 1, 2, or 4 GPU configurations targeting graphics and video encoding.


AWS offers two different AMIs that are targeted to GPU applications. In particular, they target deep learning workloads, but also provide access to more stripped-down driver-only base images.

AWS offers both an Amazon Linux Deep Learning AMI (based on Amazon Linux) as well as an Ubuntu Deep Learning AMI. Both come with most NVIDIA drivers and ancillary software (CUDA, CUBLAS, CuDNN, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) installed to lower the barrier to usage.
⛓ Note that using these AMIs can lead to lock in due to the fact that you have no direct access to software configuration or versioning.
🔸 The compendium of frameworks included can lead to long instance startup times and difficult-to-reason-about environments.


🔹As with any expensive EC2 instance types, Spot instances can offer significant savings with GPU workloads when interruptions are tolerable.



All current EC2 instance types can take advantage of IPv6 addressing, so long as they are launched in a subnet with an allocated CIDR range in an IPv6-enabled VPC.


EC2 Gotchas and Limitations

❗Never use ssh passwords. Just don’t do it; they are too insecure, and consequences of compromise too severe. Use keys instead. Read up on this and fully disable ssh password access to your ssh server by making sure 'PasswordAuthentication no' is in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. If you’re careful about managing ssh private keys everywhere they are stored, it is a major improvement on security over password-based authentication.
🔸For all newer instance types, when selecting the AMI to use, be sure you select the HVM AMI, or it just won’t work.
❗When creating an instance and using a new ssh key pair, make sure the ssh key permissions are correct.
🔸Sometimes certain EC2 instances can get scheduled for retirement by AWS due to “detected degradation of the underlying hardware,” in which case you are given a couple of weeks to migrate to a new instance

If your instance root device is an EBS volume, you can typically stop and then start the instance which moves it to healthy host hardware, giving you control over timing of this event. Note however that you will lose any instance store volume data (ephemeral drives) if your instance type has instance store volumes.
The instance public IP (if it has one) will likely change unless you're using Elastic IPs. This could be a problem if other systems depend on the IP address.


🔸Periodically you may find that your server or load balancer is receiving traffic for (presumably) a previous EC2 server that was running at the same IP address that you are handed out now (this may not matter, or it can be fixed by migrating to another new instance).
❗If the EC2 API itself is a critical dependency of your infrastructure (e.g. for automated server replacement, custom scaling algorithms, etc.) and you are running at a large scale or making many EC2 API calls, make sure that you understand when they might fail (calls to it are rate limited and the limits are not published and subject to change) and code and test against that possibility.
❗Many newer EC2 instance types are either EBS-only, or backed by local NVMe disks assigned to the instance. Make sure to factor in EBS performance and costs when planning to use them.
❗If you're operating at significant scale, you may wish to break apart API calls that enumerate all of your resources, and instead operate either on individual resources, or a subset of the entire list. EC2 APIs will time out! Consider using filters to restrict what gets returned.
❗⏱ Instances come in two types: Fixed Performance Instances (e.g. M3, C3, and R3) and Burstable Performance Instances (e.g. T2). A T2 instance receives CPU credits continuously, the rate of which depends on the instance size. T2 instances accrue CPU credits when they are idle, and use CPU credits when they are active. However, once an instance runs out of credits, you'll notice a severe degradation in performance. If you need consistently high CPU performance for applications such as video encoding, high volume websites or HPC applications, it is recommended to use Fixed Performance Instances.
Instance user-data is limited to 16 KB. (This limit applies to the data in raw form, not base64-encoded form.) If more data is needed, it can be downloaded from S3 by a user-data script.
Very new accounts may not be able to launch some instance types, such as GPU instances, because of an initially imposed “soft limit” of zero. This limit can be raised by making a support request. See AWS Service Limits for the method to make the support request. Note that this limit of zero is not currently documented.
Since multiple AWS instances all run on the same physical hardware, early cloud adopters encountered what became known as the Noisy Neighbor problem. This feeling of not getting what you are paying for led to user frustration, however ""steal"" may not be the best word to describe what's actually happening based on a detailed explanation of how the kernel determine steal time. Avoiding having CPU steal affect your application in the cloud may be best handled by properly designing your cloud architecture.
AWS introduced Dedicated Tenancy in 2011. This allows customers to have all resources from a single server. Some saw this as a way to solve the noisy neighbor problem since only that customer uses the CPU. This approach comes with a significant risk if that physical system needed any type of maintenance. If a customer had 20 instances running using shared tenancy and one underlying server needed maintenance, only the instance on that server would go offline. If that customer had 20 instances running using dedicated tenancy, when the underlying server needs maintenance, all 20 instances would go offline.
🔸Only i3.metal type instances providing an ability to run Android x86 emulators on AWS at the moment.

CloudWatch
CloudWatch Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Documentation ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
CloudWatch monitors resources and applications, captures logs, and sends events.
CloudWatch monitoring is the standard mechanism for keeping tabs on AWS resources. A wide range of  metrics and dimensions are available via CloudWatch, allowing you to create time based graphs, alarms, and dashboards.

Alarms are the most practical use of CloudWatch, allowing you to trigger notifications from any given metric.
Alarms can trigger SNS notifications, Auto Scaling actions, or EC2 actions.
Alarms also support alerting when any M out of N datapoints cross the alarm threshold.
Publish and share graphs of metrics by creating customizable dashboard views.

Monitor and report on EC2 instance system check failure alarms.




Using CloudWatch Events:

Events create a mechanism to automate actions in various services on AWS. You can create event rules from instance states, AWS APIs, Auto Scaling, Run commands, deployments or time-based schedules (think Cron).
Triggered events can invoke Lambda functions, send SNS/SQS/Kinesis messages, or perform instance actions (terminate, restart, stop, or snapshot volumes).
Custom payloads can be sent to targets in JSON format, this is especially useful when triggering Lambdas.


Using CloudWatch Logs:

CloudWatch Logs is a streaming log storage system. By storing logs within AWS you have access to unlimited paid storage, but you also have the option of streaming logs directly to ElasticSearch or custom Lambdas.
A log agent installed on your servers will process logs over time and send them to CloudWatch Logs.
You can export logged data to S3 or stream results to other AWS services.
CloudWatch Logs can be encrypted using keys managed through KMS.


Detailed monitoring: Detailed monitoring for EC2 instances must be enabled to get granular metrics, and is billed under CloudWatch.

CloudWatch Alternatives and Lock-In

CloudWatch offers fairly basic functionality that doesn't create significant (additional) AWS lock-in. Most of the metrics provided by the service can be obtained through APIs that can be imported into other aggregation or visualization tools or services (many specifically provide CloudWatch data import services).
🚪 Alternatives to CloudWatch monitoring services include NewRelic, Datadog, Sumo Logic, Zabbix, Nagios, Ruxit, Elastic Stack, open source options such as StatsD or collectd with Graphite, and many others.
🚪 CloudWatch Log alternatives include Splunk, Sumo Logic, Loggly, LogDNA, Logstash, Papertrail, Elastic Stack, and other centralized logging solutions.

CloudWatch Tips

Some very common use cases for CloudWatch are billing alarms, instance or load balancer up/down alarms, and disk usage alerts.
You can use EC2Config to monitor watch memory and disk metrics on Windows platform instances. For Linux, there are example scripts that do the same thing.
You can publish your own metrics using the AWS API. Incurs additional cost.
You can stream directly from CloudWatch Logs to a Lambda or ElasticSearch cluster by creating subscriptions on Log Groups.
Don't forget to take advantage of the CloudWatch non-expiring free tier.

CloudWatch Gotchas and Limitations

🔸Metrics in CloudWatch originate on the hypervisor. The hypervisor doesn't have access to OS information, so certain metrics (most notably memory utilization) are not available unless pushed to CloudWatch from inside the instance.
🔸You can not use more than one metric for an alarm.
🔸Notifications you receive from alarms will not have any contextual detail; they have only the specifics of the threshold, alarm state, and timing.
🔸By default, CloudWatch metric resolution is 1 minute. If you send multiple values of a metric within the same minute, they will be aggregated into minimum, maximum, average and total (sum) per minute.
🐥In July 2017, a new high-resolution option was added for CloudWatch metrics and alarms. This feature allows you to record metrics with 1-second resolution, and to evaluate CloudWatch alarms every 10 seconds.

The blog post introducing this feature describes how to publish a high-resolution metric to CloudWatch. Note that when calling the PutMetricData API, StorageResolution is an attribute of each item you send in the MetricData array, not a direct parameter of the PutMetricData API call.


🔸Data about metrics is kept in CloudWatch for 15 months, starting November 2016 (used to be 14 days). Minimum granularity increases after 15 days.

AMIs
AMI Basics

📒 User guide
AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are immutable images that are used to launch preconfigured EC2 instances. They come in both public and private flavors. Access to public AMIs is either freely available (shared/community AMIs) or bought and sold in the AWS Marketplace.
Many operating system vendors publish ready-to-use base AMIs. For Ubuntu, see the Ubuntu AMI Finder. Amazon of course has AMIs for Amazon Linux.

AMI Tips

AMIs are built independently based on how they will be deployed. You must select AMIs that match your deployment when using them or creating them:

EBS or instance store
PV or HVM virtualization types
32 bit (“i386”) vs 64 bit (“amd64”) architecture


As discussed above, modern deployments will usually be with 64-bit EBS-backed HVM.
You can create your own custom AMI by snapshotting the state of an EC2 instance that you have modified.
AMIs backed by EBS storage have the necessary image data loaded into the EBS volume itself and don’t require an extra pull from S3, which results in EBS-backed instances coming up much faster than instance storage-backed ones.
AMIs are per region, so you must look up AMIs in your region, or copy your AMIs between regions with the AMI Copy feature.
As with other AWS resources, it’s wise to use tags to version AMIs and manage their lifecycle.
If you create your own AMIs, there is always some tension in choosing how much installation and configuration you want to “bake” into them.

Baking less into your AMIs (for example, just a configuration management client that downloads, installs, and configures software on new EC2 instances when they are launched) allows you to minimize time spent automating AMI creation and managing the AMI lifecycle (you will likely be able to use fewer AMIs and will probably not need to update them as frequently), but results in longer waits before new instances are ready for use and results in a higher chance of launch-time installation or configuration failures.
Baking more into your AMIs (for example, pre-installing but not fully configuring common software along with a configuration management client that loads configuration settings at launch time) results in a faster launch time and fewer opportunities for your software installation and configuration to break at instance launch time but increases the need for you to create and manage a robust AMI creation pipeline.
Baking even more into your AMIs (for example, installing all required software as well and potentially also environment-specific configuration information) results in fast launch times and a much lower chance of instance launch-time failures but (without additional re-deployment and re-configuration considerations) can require time consuming AMI updates in order to update software or configuration as well as more complex AMI creation automation processes.


Which option you favor depends on how quickly you need to scale up capacity, and size and maturity of your team and product.

When instances boot fast, auto-scaled services require less spare capacity built in and can more quickly scale up in response to sudden increases in load. When setting up a service with autoscaling, consider baking more into your AMIs and backing them with the EBS storage option.
As systems become larger, it common to have more complex AMI management, such as a multi-stage AMI creation process in which few (ideally one) common base AMIs are infrequently regenerated when components that are common to all deployed services are updated and then a more frequently run “service-level” AMI generation process that includes installation and possibly configuration of application-specific software.


More thinking on AMI creation strategies here.
Use tools like Packer to simplify and automate AMI creation.
If you use RHEL instances and happen to have existing RHEL on-premise Red Hat subscriptions, then you could leverage Red Hat's Cloud Access program to migrate a portion of your subscriptions to AWS, and thereby not having AWS charge you for RHEL subscriptions a second time. You can either use your own self-created RHEL AMI's or Red Hat provided Gold Images that will be added to your private AMI's once you sign up for Red Hat Cloud Access.

AMI Gotchas and Limitations


🔸Amazon Linux package versions: By default, instances based on Amazon Linux AMIs are configured point to the latest versions of packages in Amazon’s package repository. This means that the package versions that get installed are not locked and it is possible for changes, including breaking ones, to appear when applying updates in the future. If you bake your AMIs with updates already applied, this is unlikely to cause problems in running services whose instances are based on those AMIs – breaks will appear at the earlier AMI-baking stage of your build process, and will need to be fixed or worked around before new AMIs can be generated. There is a “lock on launch” feature that allows you to configure Amazon Linux instances to target the repository of a particular major version of the Amazon Linux AMI, reducing the likelihood that breaks caused by Amazon-initiated package version changes will occur at package install time but at the cost of not having updated packages get automatically installed by future update runs. Pairing use of the “lock on launch” feature with a process to advance the Amazon Linux AMI at your discretion can give you tighter control over update behaviors and timings.


Cloud-Init Defaults: Oftentimes users create AMIs after performing customizations (albeit manually or via some tool such as Packer or Ansible).  If you're not careful to alter cloud-init settings that correspond to the system service (e.g. sshd, etc.) you've customized, you may find that your changes are no longer in effect after booting your new AMI for the first time, as cloud-init has overwritten them.
Some distros have different files than others, but all are generally located in /etc/cloud/, regardless of distro.  You will want to review these files carefully for your chosen distro before rolling your own AMIs.  A complete reference to cloud-init is available on the cloud-init site.  This is an advanced configuration mechanism, so test any changes made to these files in a sandbox prior to any serious usage.


Auto Scaling
Auto Scaling Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing at no additional charge
Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) are used to control the number of instances in a service, reducing manual effort to provision or deprovision EC2 instances.
They can be configured through Scaling Policies to automatically increase or decrease instance counts based on metrics like CPU utilization, or based on a schedule.
There are three common ways of using ASGs - dynamic (automatically adjust instance count based on metrics for things like CPU utilization), static (maintain a specific instance count at all times), scheduled (maintain different instance counts at different times of day or on days of the week).
💸ASGs have no additional charge themselves; you pay for underlying EC2 and CloudWatch services.

Auto Scaling Tips

💸 Better matching your cluster size to your current resource requirements through use of ASGs can result in significant cost savings for many types of workloads.
Pairing ASGs with CLBs is a common pattern used to deal with changes in the amount of traffic a service receives.
Dynamic Auto Scaling is easiest to use with stateless, horizontally scalable services.
Even if you are not using ASGs to dynamically increase or decrease instance counts, you should seriously consider maintaining all instances inside of ASGs – given a target instance count, the ASG will work to ensure that number of instances running is equal to that target, replacing instances for you if they die or are marked as being unhealthy. This results in consistent capacity and better stability for your service.
Autoscalers can be configured to terminate instances that a CLB or ALB has marked as being unhealthy.

Auto Scaling Gotchas and Limitations

🔸ReplaceUnhealthy setting: By default, ASGs will kill instances that the EC2 instance manager considers to be unresponsive. It is possible for instances whose CPU is completely saturated for minutes at a time to appear to be unresponsive, causing an ASG with the default ReplaceUnhealthy setting turned on to replace them. When instances that are managed by ASGs are expected to consistently run with very high CPU, consider deactivating this setting. If you do so, however, detecting and killing unhealthy nodes will become your responsibility.

EBS
EBS Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides block level storage. That is, it offers storage volumes that can be attached as filesystems, like traditional network drives.
EBS volumes can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time. In contrast, EFS can be shared but has a much higher price point (a comparison).

EBS Tips

⏱RAID: Use RAID drives for increased performance.
⏱A worthy read is AWS’ post on EBS IO characteristics as well as their performance tips.
⏱One can provision IOPS (that is, pay for a specific level of I/O operations per second) to ensure a particular level of performance for a disk.
⏱A single EBS volume allows 10k IOPS max. To get the maximum performance out of an EBS volume, it has to be of a maximum size and attached to an EBS-optimized EC2 instance.
💸Standard EBS volumes improve IOPS with size. It may make sense for you to simply enlarge a volume instead of paying for better performance explicitly. This can in many cases reduce costs by 2/3.
A standard block size for an EBS volume is 16kb.

EBS Gotchas and Limitations

❗EBS durability is reasonably good for a regular hardware drive (annual failure rate of between 0.1% - 0.2%). On the other hand, that is very poor if you don’t have backups! By contrast, S3 durability is extremely high. If you care about your data, back it up to S3 with snapshots.
🔸EBS has an SLA with 99.99% uptime. See notes on high availability below.
❗EBS volumes have a volume type indicating the physical storage type. The types called “standard” (st1 or sc1) are actually old spinning-platter disks, which deliver only hundreds of IOPS — not what you want unless you’re really trying to cut costs. Modern SSD-based gp2 or io1 are typically the options you want.
❗When restoring a snapshot to create an EBS volume, blocks are lazily read from S3 the first time they're referenced. To avoid an initial period of high latency, you may wish to use dd or fio as per the official documentation.

EFS
EFS Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
🐥EFS is Amazon’s network filesystem. It’s presented as an NFSv4.1 server. Any compatible NFSv4 client can mount it.
It is designed to be highly available and durable and each EFS file system object is redundantly stored across multiple availability zones.
EFS is designed to be used as a shared network drive and it can automatically scale up to petabytes of stored data and thousands of instances attached to it.
EFS can offer higher throughput (multiple gigabytes per second) and better durability and availability than EBS (see the comparison table), but with higher latency.
EFS is priced based on the volume of data stored, and costs much more than EBS; it's in the ballpark of three times as much compared to general purpose gp2 EBS volumes.
⏱ Performance is dependent on the volume of data stored, as is the price:

Like EBS, EFS uses a credit based system. Credits are earned at a rate of 50 KiB/s per GiB of storage and consumed in bursts during reading/writing files or metadata. Unlike EBS, operations on metadata (file size, owner, date, etc.) also consume credits. The BurstCreditBalance metric in CloudWatch should be monitored to make sure the file system doesn't run out of credits.
Throughput capacity during bursts is also dependent on size. Under 1 TiB, throughput can go up to 100 MiB/s. Above that, 100 MiB/s is added for each stored TiB. For instance, a file system storing 5 TiB would be able to burst at a rate of 500 MiB/s. Maximum throughput per EC2 instance is 250 MiB/s.
EFS has two performance modes that can only be set when a file system is created. One is ""General Purpose"", the other is ""Max I/O"". Max I/O scales higher, but at the cost of higher latency. When in doubt, use General Purpose, which is also the default. If the PercentIOLimit metric in CloudWatch hovers around 100%, Max I/O is recommended. Changing performance mode means creating a new EFS and migrating data.


High availability is achieved by having mount targets in different subnets / availability zones.

EFS Tips


With EFS being based on NFSv4.1, any directory on the EFS can be mounted directly, it doesn't have to be the root directory. One application could mount fs-12345678:/prog1, another fs-12345678:/prog2.


User and group level permissions can be used to control access to certain directories on the EFS file system.


⏱ Sharing EFS filesystems: One EFS filesystem can be used for multiple applications or services, but it should be considered carefully:
Pros:

Because performance is based on total size of stored files, having everything on one drive will increase performance for everyone. One application consuming credits faster than it can accumulate might be offset by another application that just stores files on EFS and rarely accesses them.

Cons:

Since credits are shared, if one application over-consumes them, it will affect the others.
A compromise is made with regards to security: all clients will have to have network access to the drive. Someone with root access on one client instance can mount any directory on the EFS and they have read-write access to all files on the drive, even if they don't have access to the applications hosted on other clients. There isn't a no-root-squash equivalent for EFS.



EFS Gotchas and Limitations

🔸 A number of NFSv4.1 features are not supported and there are some limits to the service.
🔸 As of 2017-08, EFS offers disk level encryption for new drives. For file systems created before that date, encryption can only be achieved by moving the data to a new EFS volume.
🔸 An EFS file system can be mounted on premises over Direct Connect.
🔸 An EFS file system can NOT be mounted over VPC peering or VPN, even if the VPN is running on top of Direct Connect.
🔸 Using an EFS volume on Windows is not supported.
⏱ When a file is uploaded to EFS, it can take hours for EFS to update the details for billing and burst credit purposes.
🔸⏱  Metadata operations can be costly in terms of burst credit consumption. Recursively traversing a tree containing thousands of files can easily ramp up to tens or even hundreds of megabytes of burst credits being consumed, even if no file is being touched. Commands like find or chown -R can have an adverse impact on performance.

Load Balancers
Load Balancer Basics

AWS has 3 load balancing products - “Classic Load Balancers” (CLBs), “Application Load Balancers” (ALBs), and ""Network Load Balancers"" (NLB).
Before the introduction of ALBs, “Classic Load Balancers” were known as “Elastic Load Balancers” (ELBs), so older documentation, tooling, and blog posts may still reference “ELBs”.
CLBs have been around since 2009, ALBs in 2016, NLBs were added in 2017 to AWS.
CLBs support TCP and HTTP load balancing. ALBs support HTTP load balancing only. NLBs support TCP layer 4 load balancing.
CLBs and ALBs can optionally handle termination for a single SSL certificate.
All can optionally perform active health checks of instances and remove them from the destination pool if they become unhealthy.
CLBs don't support complex / rule-based routing. ALBs support a (currently small) set of rule-based routing features. NLBs have most extensive routing options.
CLBs can only forward traffic to a single globally configured port on destination instances, while ALBs can forward to ports that are configured on a per-instance basis, better supporting routing to services on shared clusters with dynamic port assignment (like ECS or Mesos). NLBs support multiple ports on same IP; registering targets by IP address, including targets outside the VPC for the load balancer; ECS can select unused port for scheduling a task then register a target group using this port.
CLBs are supported in EC2 Classic as well as in VPCs while ALBs are supported in VPCs only.
ALBs can target groups of instances and IP based targets in the RFC1918 ranges allowing you to use on premise destinations via VPN or Direct Connect.

Load Balancer Tips

If you don’t have opinions on your load balancing up front, and don’t have complex load balancing needs like application-specific routing of requests, it’s reasonable just to use a CLB or ALB for load balancing instead.
Even if you don’t want to think about load balancing at all, because your architecture is so simple (say, just one server), put a load balancer in front of it anyway. This gives you more flexibility when upgrading, since you won’t have to change any DNS settings that will be slow to propagate, and also it lets you do a few things like terminate SSL more easily.
CLBs and ALBs have many IPs: Internally, an AWS load balancer is simply a collection of individual software load balancers hosted within EC2, with DNS load balancing traffic among them. The pool can contain many IPs, at least one per availability zone, and depending on traffic levels. They also support SSL termination, which is very convenient.
Scaling: CLBs and ALBs can scale to very high throughput, but scaling up is not instantaneous. If you’re expecting to be hit with a lot of traffic suddenly, it can make sense to load test them so they scale up in advance. You can also contact Amazon and have them “pre-warm” the load balancer.
Client IPs: In general, if servers want to know true client IP addresses, load balancers must forward this information somehow. CLBs add the standard X-Forwarded-For header. When using a CLB as an HTTP load balancer, it’s possible to get the client’s IP address from this.
Using load balancers when deploying: One common pattern is to swap instances in the load balancer after spinning up a new stack with your latest version, keep old stack running for one or two hours, and either flip back to old stack in case of problems or tear it down.
Rotating Certificates while retaining ARN: Rotating IAM Server Certificates can be difficult as the standard practice is to upload a new one then update all resources with the new ARN. You can however retain the same ARN using the update-certificate call with the following process:


Upload a new IAM Server Certificate with a unique name (e.g fuzzy.com.new)
Rename the existing IAM Server Certificate (e.g fuzzy.com to fuzzy.com.expired)
Rename the new IAM Server Certificate to the name of the previously existing certificate (e.g fuzzy.com.new to fuzzy.com)
Jiggle the CLB/ALB Listener to pick up the change:

ALB: Invoke modify-listener with the existing details for the ALB Listener
CLB: Invoke create-load-balancer-listeners with the existing details for the CLB listener



Load Balancer Gotchas and Limitations

❗CLBs and ALBs have no fixed external IP that all clients see. For most consumer apps this doesn’t matter, but enterprise customers of yours may want this. IPs will be different for each user, and will vary unpredictably for a single client over time (within the standard EC2 IP ranges). And similarly, never resolve a CLB name to an IP and put it as the value of an A record — it will work for a while, then break!
❗Some web clients or reverse proxies cache DNS lookups for a long time, which is problematic for CLBs and ALBs, since they change their IPs. This means after a few minutes, hours, or days, your client will stop working, unless you disable DNS caching. Watch out for Java’s settings and be sure to adjust them properly. Another example is nginx as a reverse proxy, which normally resolves backends only at start-up (although there is a way to get around this).
❗It’s not unheard of for IPs to be recycled between customers without a long cool-off period. So as a client, if you cache an IP and are not using SSL (to verify the server), you might get not just errors, but responses from completely different services or companies!
🔸As an operator of a service behind a CLB or ALB, the latter phenomenon means you can also see puzzling or erroneous requests by clients of other companies. This is most common with clients using back-end APIs (since web browsers typically cache for a limited period).
❗CLBs and ALBs take time to scale up, it does not handle sudden spikes in traffic well. Therefore, if you anticipate a spike, you need to “pre-warm” the load balancer by gradually sending an increasing amount of traffic.
❗Tune your healthchecks carefully — if you are too aggressive about deciding when to remove an instance and conservative about adding it back into the pool, the service that your load balancer is fronting may become inaccessible for seconds or minutes at a time. Be extra careful about this when an autoscaler is configured to terminate instances that are marked as being unhealthy by a managed load balancer.
❗CLB HTTPS listeners don't support Server Name Indication (SNI). If you need SNI, you can work around this limitation by either providing a certificate with Subject Alternative Names (SANs) or by using TCP listeners and terminating SSL at your backend.
🔸 There is a limit on the number of ALBs, CLBs and NLBs per region (separately). As of late 2017, the default limit for each is 20 per region. These limits can be easily raised for ALB and CLB, but AWS is quite reluctant to raise the limit on NLBs.
🔸 If using a Network Load Balancer (NLB) then EC2 clients cannot connect to an NLB that resides in another VPC (VPC Peering) or AWS managed VPN unless the EC2 client is a C5, i3.metal or M5 instance type. For VPC peering, both VPCs must be in the same region. See Troubleshooting.

CLB
CLB Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Classic Load Balancers, formerly known as Elastic Load Balancers, are HTTP and TCP load balancers that are managed and scaled for you by Amazon.

CLB Tips

Best practices: This article is a must-read if you use CLBs heavily, and has a lot more detail.

CLB Gotchas and Limitations

In general, CLBs are not as “smart” as some load balancers, and don’t have fancy features or fine-grained control a traditional hardware load balancer would offer. For most common cases involving sessionless apps or cookie-based sessions over HTTP, or SSL termination, they work well.
🔸By default, CLBs will refuse to route traffic from a load balancer in one Availability Zone (AZ) to a backend instance in another. This will cause 503s if the last instance in an AZ becomes unavailable, even if there are healthy instances in other zones. If you’re running fewer than two backend instances per AZ, you almost certainly want to enable cross-zone load balancing.
🔸Complex rules for directing traffic are not supported. For example, you can’t direct traffic based on a regular expression in the URL, like HAProxy offers.
Apex DNS names: Once upon a time, you couldn’t assign a CLB to an apex DNS record (i.e. example.com instead of foo.example.com) because it needed to be an A record instead of a CNAME. This is now possible with a Route 53 alias record directly pointing to the load balancer.
🔸CLBs use HTTP keep-alives on the internal side. This can cause an unexpected side effect: Requests from different clients, each in their own TCP connection on the external side, can end up on the same TCP connection on the internal side. Never assume that multiple requests on the same TCP connection are from the same client!
🔸 Traffic between CLBs and back-end instances in the same subnet will have Network ACL rules evaluated (EC2 to EC2 traffic in the same subnet would not have Network ACL rules evaluated). If the default '0.0.0.0/0 ALLOW' rule is removed from the Network ACL applied to the subnet, a rule that allows traffic on both the health check port and any listener port must be added.
As of December 2016, CLBs launched in VPCs do not support IPv6 addressing. CLBs launched in EC2-Classic support both IPv4 and IPv6 with the ""dualstack"" DNS name.

ALB
ALB Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
🐥Websockets and HTTP/2 are now supported.
🐥Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is now supported.
🐥Load Balancing via IP is now supported.
Prior to the Application Load Balancer, you were advised to use TCP instead of HTTP as the protocol to make it work (as described here) and use the obscure but useful Proxy Protocol (more on this) to pass client IPs over a TCP load balancer.

ALB Tips

Use ALBs to route to services that are hosted on shared clusters with dynamic port assignment (like ECS or Mesos).
ALBs support HTTP host-based routing (send HTTP requests for “api.mydomain.com” -> {target-group-1}, “blog.mydomain.com” -> {target group 2}) as well as HTTP path-based routing (send HTTP requests for “/api/*” ->  {target-group-1}, “/blog/*” -> {target group 2}).

ALB Gotchas and Limitations

🔸ALBs only support HTTP/2 over HTTPS (no plain-text HTTP/2).
🔸ALBs only support HTTP/2 to external clients and not to internal resources (instances/containers).
ALBs support HTTP routing but not port-based TCP routing.
Instances in the ALB’s target groups have to either have a single, fixed healthcheck port (“EC2 instance”-level healthcheck) or the healthcheck port for a target has to be the same as its application port (“Application instance”-level healthcheck) - you can't configure a per-target healthcheck port that is different than the application port.
ALBs are VPC-only (they are not available in EC2 Classic)
In a target group, if there is no healthy target, all requests are routed to all targets. For example, if you point a listener at a target group containing a single service that has a long initialization phase (during which the health checks would fail), requests will reach the service while it is still starting up.
📜 Although ALBs now support SNI, they only support 25 HTTPS certificates per Load Balancer. This limitation is not described here, so it might be subject to change.

Elastic Beanstalk
Elastic Beanstalk Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
EB (Elastic Beanstalk) is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that helps developers create, deploy and scale web applications
EB handles deployment, configuration, provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, monitoring, and logging
EB creates AWS resources on your behalf but you retain full access and control of the underlying resources
💸 There is no cost to use EB but you will still be charged the full cost of the underlying AWS resources created by EB

Elastic Beanstalk Tips

To speed up deployment before launch or in a dev stage, turn off health checks and set the Deployment policy to All at once
If you have a configuration you want to re-use for multiple EB apps, you can save the current configuration using eb config save --cfg myEBConfig
By default, EB doesn't have any alarms. You'll need to add them yourself on metrics that you're monitoring.
By default, EB doesn't enable managed platform updates. Enable them in configuration to have EB automatically apply updates during a pre-specified maintenance window

Elastic Beanstalk Gotchas and Limitations

🔸 Don't edit [apache|nginx] conf files manually on ec2 instances as they will be re-written on each deployment (use ebextensions instead)
🔸 After creating an EB environment, it's no longer possible to change the Name tag
🔸 EB will sometimes quarantine instances that cause multiple deployment issues. Despite being quarantined, EB will still deploy to them on subsequent deployments. To prevent this behavior, said instances will need to be terminated (or the underlying issue fixed)
File uploads are capped at 10MB for most default eb configurations - update nginx config to change
If you edit .elasticbeanstalk/saved_configs/, be aware that this is not kept in sync with the EB environment config. You'll need to manually fetch and save for changes to take effect

Elastic IPs
Elastic IP Basics

📒 Documentation ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Elastic IPs are static IP addresses you can rent from AWS to assign to EC2 instances.

Elastic IP Tips

🔹Prefer load balancers to elastic IPs: For single-instance deployments, you could just assign elastic IP to an instance, give that IP a DNS name, and consider that your deployment. Most of the time, you should provision a load balancer instead:

It’s easy to add and remove instances from load balancers. It’s also quicker to add or remove instances from a load balancer than to reassign an elastic IP.
It’s more convenient to point DNS records to load balancers, instead of pointing them to specific IPs you manage manually. They can also be Route 53 aliases, which are easier to change and manage.
But in some situations, you do need to manage and fix IP addresses of EC2 instances, for example if a customer needs a fixed IP. These situations require elastic IPs.


Elastic IPs are limited to 5 per account. It’s possible to request more.
If an Elastic IP is not attached to an active resource there is a small hourly fee.
Elastic IPs are no extra charge as long as you’re using them. They have a (small) cost when not in use, which is a mechanism to prevent people from squatting on excessive numbers of IP addresses.

Elastic IP Gotchas and Limitations

🔸There is officially no way to allocate a contiguous block of IP addresses, something you may desire when giving IPs to external users. Though when allocating at once, you may get lucky and have some be part of the same CIDR block.

Glacier
Glacier Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Glacier is a lower-cost alternative to S3 when data is infrequently accessed, such as for archival purposes.
It’s only useful for data that is rarely accessed. It generally takes 3-5 hours to fulfill a retrieval request.
AWS has not officially revealed the storage media used by Glacier; it may be low-spin hard drives or even tapes.

Glacier Tips

You can physically ship your data to Amazon to put on Glacier on a USB or eSATA HDD.

Glacier Gotchas and Limitations

🔸Getting files off Glacier is glacially slow (typically 3-5 hours or more).
🔸Due to a fixed overhead per file (you pay per PUT or GET operation), uploading and downloading many small files on/to Glacier might be very expensive. There is also a 32k storage overhead per file. Hence it’s a good idea is to archive files before upload.
🔸Glacier’s pricing policy is reportedly pretty complicated: “Glacier data retrievals are priced based on the peak hourly retrieval capacity used within a calendar month.” Some more info can be found here and here.
💸Be aware of the per-object costs of archiving S3 data to Glacier. It costs $0.05 per 1,000 requests. If you have large numbers of S3 objects of relatively small size, it will take time to reach a break-even point (initial archiving cost versus lower storage pricing).

RDS
RDS Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing (see also ec2instances.info/rds/)
RDS is a managed relational database service, allowing you to deploy and scale databases more easily. It supports Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and Amazon’s own Aurora.
RDS offers out of the box support for high availability and failover for your databases.

RDS Tips

If you're looking for the managed convenience of RDS for other data stores such as MongoDB or Cassandra, you may wish to consider third-party services from providers such as mLab, Compose, or InstaClustr.
🔹Make sure to create a new parameter group and option group for your database since the default parameter group does not allow dynamic configuration changes.
RDS instances start with a default timezone of UTC. If necessary, this can be changed to a different timezone.

RDS Gotchas and Limitations

⏱RDS instances run on EBS volumes (either general-purpose or provisioned IOPS), and hence are constrained by EBS performance.
🔸Verify what database features you need, as not everything you might want is available on RDS. For example, if you are using Postgres, check the list of supported features and extensions. If the features you need aren't supported by RDS, you'll have to deploy your database yourself.
🔸If you use the failover support offered by RDS, keep in mind that it is based on DNS changes, and make sure that your client reacts to these changes appropriately. This is particularly important for Java, given how its DNS resolver’s TTL is configured by default.
🔸DB migration to RDS: While importing your database into RDS ensure you take into consideration the maintenance window settings. If a backup is running at the same time, your import can take a considerably longer time than you would have expected.
Database sizes are limited to 6TB for all database engines except for SQL Server which has a 4TB limit and Aurora which supports up to 64TB databases.

RDS MySQL and MariaDB
RDS MySQL and MariaDB Basics


 RDS offers MySQL versions 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8.



 RDS offers MariaDB versions 10.0, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3.



RDS MySQL and MariaDB Tips

MySQL RDS allows access to binary logs.
Multi-AZ instances of MySQL transparently replicate data across AZs using DRBD. Automated backups of multi-AZ instances run off the backup instance to reduce latency spikes on the primary.
🔸Performance Schema: While Performance Schema is enabled by default in MySQL 5.6.6 and later, it is disabled by default in all versions of RDS. If you wish to enable Performance Schema, a reboot of the RDS instance will be required.
🔸MySQL vs MariaDB vs Aurora: If you prefer a MySQL-style database but are starting something new, you probably should consider Aurora and MariaDB as well. Aurora has increased availability and is the next-generation solution. That said, Aurora may not be that much faster than MySQL for certain workloads. MariaDB, the modern community fork of MySQL, likely now has the edge over MySQL for many purposes and is supported by RDS.

RDS MySQL and MariaDB Gotchas and Limitations

🔸No SUPER privileges. RDS provides some stored procedures to perform some tasks that require SUPER privileges such as starting or stopping replication.
🔸You can replicate to non-RDS instances of MySQL, but replication to these instances will break during AZ failovers.
🔸There is no ability to manually CHANGE MASTER on replicas, so they must all be rebuilt after a failover of the master.
🔸Most global options are exposed only via DB parameter groups. Some variables that were introduced in later MySQL dot releases such as avoid_temporal_upgrade in MySQL 5.6.24 are not made available in RDS's 5.6.x parameter group and making use of them requires an upgrade to MySQL 5.7.x.
🔸RDS features such as Point-In-Time restore and snapshot restore are not supported on MyISAM tables. Ensure you lock and flush each MyISAM table before executing a snapshot or backup operation to ensure consistency.

RDS PostgreSQL
RDS PostgreSQL Basics

RDS offers PostgreSQL 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, and 10.

RDS PostgreSQL Tips

Recently Logical Replication is being supported, both as subscriber and publisher.
Supports a relatively large range of native extensions.
RDS PostgreSQL 10 Supports native partitioning and most of the major features and tunables.
Supports connections over SSL.
Supports multi A-Z and Point-in-time recovery.

RDS PostgreSQL Gotchas and Limitations

No superuser privileges. RDS provides a role rds_superuser that can do most of the needed operations but there are some limitations.
Some major features are delayed compared to open source PostgreSQL.
By default RDS is spec’d with general purpose SSD , if you need better performance you have to spec provisioned IOPS SSD.
You can't use RDS as a replica outside RDS without using logical replication.
There are settings that cannot be changed and most of the settings that can change can only be changed using database parameter groups.
It’s harder to troubleshoot performance problems since you have no access to the host.
Be sure to verify that all the extensions you need are available. If you are using an extension not listed there, you will need to come up with a work around, or deploy your own database in EC2.
Many Postgres utilities and maintenance items expect command line access, that can usually be satisfied by using an external ec2 server.

RDS SQL Server
RDS SQL Server Basics

RDS offers SQL Server 2008 R2, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017 including Express, Web, Standard and Enterprise.

RDS SQL Server Tips

Recently added support for backup and restore to/from S3 which may make it an attractive DR option for on-premises installations.

RDS SQL Server Gotchas and Limitations

🔸The user is granted only db_owner privileges for each database on the instance.
🔸Storage cannot be expanded for existing databases. If you need more space, you must restore your database on a new instance with larger storage.
🔸There is a 16TB database size limit for non-Express editions. There is also a minimum storage size, 20GB for Web and Express, 200GB for Standard and Enterprise.
🔸Limited to 30 databases per instance

RDS Aurora
RDS Aurora Basics
Aurora is a cloud only database service designed to provide a distributed, fault-tolerant relational database with self-healing storage and auto-scaling up to 64TB per instance.  It currently comes in two versions, a MySQL compatible system, and a PostgreSQL compatible system.
RDS Aurora MySQL
RDS Aurora MySQL Basics

Amazon’s proprietary fork of MySQL intended to scale up for high concurrency workloads. Generally speaking, individual query performance under Aurora is not expected to improve significantly relative to MySQL or MariaDB, but Aurora is intended to maintain performance while executing many more queries concurrently than an equivalent MySQL or MariaDB server could handle.
Notable new features include:

Log-structured storage instead of B-trees to improve write performance.
Out-of-process buffer pool so that databases instances can be restarted without clearing the buffer pool.
The underlying physical storage is a specialized SSD array that automatically maintains 6 copies of your data across 3 AZs.
Aurora read replicas share the storage layer with the write master which significantly reduces replica lag, eliminates the need for the master to write and distribute the binary log for replication, and allows for zero-data-loss failovers from the master to a replica. The master and all the read replicas that share storage are known collectively as an Aurora cluster. Read replicas can span up to 5 regions.



RDS Aurora MySQL Tips

In order to take advantage of Aurora’s higher concurrency, applications should be configured with large database connection pools and should execute as many queries concurrently as possible. For example, Aurora servers have been tested to produce increasing performance on some OLTP workloads with up to 5,000 connections.
Aurora scales well with multiple CPUs and may require a large instance class for optimal performance.
The easiest migration path to Aurora is restoring a database snapshot from MySQL 5.6 or 5.7. The next easiest method is restoring a dump from a MySQL-compatible database such as MariaDB. For low-downtime migrations from other MySQL-compatible databases, you can set up an Aurora instance as a replica of your existing database. If none of those methods are options, Amazon offers a fee-based data migration service.
You can replicate from an Aurora cluster to MySQL or to another Aurora cluster. This requires binary logging to be enabled and is not as performant as native Aurora replication.
Because Aurora read replicas are the equivalent of a multi-AZ backup and they can be configured as zero-data-loss failover targets, there are fewer scenarios in which the creation of a multi-AZ Aurora instance is required.

RDS Aurora MySQL Gotchas and Limitations

🔸Aurora 1.x is based on MySQL 5.6.x with some cherry-picking of later MySQL features. It is missing most 5.7 features as well as some online DDL features introduced in 5.6.17.
🔸Aurora 2.x is based on MySQL 5.7.x
Aurora does not support GTID transactions in either the 5.6/Aurora 1.x or the 5.7/Aurora 2.x release lines.
Aurora maximum cluster size is 64 TB

RDS Aurora PostgreSQL
RDS Aurora PostgreSQL Basics

Amazon’s proprietary fork of PostgreSQL, intended to scale up for high concurrency workloads while maintaining ease of use. Currently based on PostgreSQL 9.6.
Higher throughput (up to 3x with similar hardware).
Automatic storage scale in 10GB increments up to 64TB.
Low latency read replicas that share the storage layer with the master which significantly reduces replica lag.
Point in time recovery.

Aurora Postgres by default is supposed to utilize high connection rates and for this reason connection pooling must be configured accordingly.
Because Aurora is based on PostgreSQL 9.6, it lacks features like declarative partitioning or logical replication.

RDS Aurora PostgreSQL Gotchas and Limitations

Aurora PostgreSQL falls behind normal RDS when it comes to available versions, so if you need features from the latest PostgreSQL version you might be better off with plain RDS.
Patching and bug fixing is separate from open source PostgreSQL.

ElastiCache is a managed in-memory cache service, that can be used to
store temporary data in a fast in-memory cache, typically in order to avoid
repeating the same computation multiple times when it could be reused.
It supports both the Memcached and
Redis open source in-memory cache software and exposes
them both using their native access APIs.
The main benefit is that AWS takes care of running, patching and optimizing
the cache nodes for you, so you just need to launch a cluster and configure
its endpoint in your application, while AWS will take of most of the operational
work of running the cache nodes.

ElastiCache Tips

Choose the
engine,
clustering configuration and instance
type
carefully based on your application needs. The documentation explains in
detail the pros, cons and limitations of each engine in order to help you
choose the best fit for your application. In a nutshell, Redis is
preferable for storing more complex data structures, while Memcached is just a
plain key/value store. The simplicity of Memcached allows it to be slightly
faster and allows it to scale out if needed, but Redis has more features which
you may use in your application.
For Memcached AWS provides enhanced SDKs for certain programming languages
which implement
auto-discovery,
a feature not available in the normal memcached client libraries.

ElastiCache Gotchas and Limitations

Since in some cases changing the cache clusters may have some restrictions,
like for
scaling
purposes, it may become a problem if they were launched using CloudFormation
in a stack that also contains other resources and you really need to change
the cache. In order to avoid getting your CloudFormation stacks in a
non-updateable state, it is recommended to launch ElastiCache clusters (just
like any other resource with similar constraints) in dedicated stacks which
can be replaced entirely with new stacks having the desired configuration.

DynamoDB
DynamoDB Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
DynamoDB is a NoSQL database with focuses on speed, flexibility, and scalability.
DynamoDB is priced on a combination of throughput and storage.

DynamoDB Alternatives and Lock-in

⛓ Unlike the technologies behind many other Amazon products, DynamoDB is a proprietary AWS product with no interface-compatible alternative available as an open source project. If you tightly couple your application to its API and featureset, it will take significant effort to replace.
The most commonly used alternative to DynamoDB is Cassandra.

DynamoDB Tips

There is a local version of DynamoDB provided for developer use.
DynamoDB Streams provides an ordered stream of changes to a table. Use it to replicate, back up, or drive events off of data
DynamoDB can be used as a simple locking service.
DynamoDB indexing can include primary keys, which can either be a single-attribute hash key or a composite hash-key range. You can also query non-primary key attributes using secondary indexes.
Data Types: DynamoDB supports three data types – number, string, and binary – in both scalar and multi-valued sets. DynamoDB can also support JSON.
As of late 2017, DynamoDB supports both global tables and backup / restore functionality.

DynamoDB Gotchas and Limitations

🔸 DynamoDB doesn’t provide an easy way to bulk-load data (it is possible through Data Pipeline) and this has some unfortunate consequences. Since you need to use the regular service APIs to update existing or create new rows, it is common to temporarily turn up a destination table’s write throughput to speed import. But when the table’s write capacity is increased, DynamoDB may do an irreversible split of the partitions underlying the table, spreading the total table capacity evenly across the new generation of tables. Later, if the capacity is reduced, the capacity for each partition is also reduced but the total number of partitions is not, leaving less capacity for each partition. This leaves the table in a state where it much easier for hotspots to overwhelm individual partitions.
🔸 It is important to make sure that DynamoDB resource limits are compatible with your dataset and workload. For example, the maximum size value that can be added to a DynamoDB table is 400 KB (larger items can be stored in S3 and a URL stored in DynamoDB).
🔸 Dealing with time series data in DynamoDB can be challenging. A global secondary index together with down sampling timestamps can be a possible solution as explained here.
🔸 DynamoDB does not allow an empty string as a valid attribute value. The most common work-around is to use a substitute value instead of leaving the field empty.
🔸 When setting up fine grained policies for access to DynamoDB tables, be sure to include their secondary indices in the policy document as well.

ECS
ECS Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
ECS (EC2 Container Service) is a relatively new service (launched end of 2014) that manages clusters of services deployed via Docker.
See the Containers and AWS section for more context on containers.
ECS is growing in adoption, especially for companies that embrace microservices.
Deploying Docker directly in EC2 yourself is another common approach to using Docker on AWS. Using ECS is not required, and ECS does not (yet) seem to be the predominant way many companies are using Docker on AWS.
It’s also possible to use Elastic Beanstalk with Docker, which is reasonable if you’re already using Elastic Beanstalk.
Using Docker may change the way your services are deployed within EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk, but it does not radically change how most other services are used.
ECR (EC2 Container Registry) is Amazon’s managed Docker registry service. While simpler than running your own registry, it is missing some features that might be desired by some users:

Doesn’t support cross-region replication of images.

If you want fast fleet-wide pulls of large images, you’ll need to push your image into a region-local registry.


Doesn’t support custom domains / certificates.


A container’s health is monitored via CLB or ALB. Those can also be used to address a containerized service. When using an ALB you do not need to handle port contention (i.e. services exposing the same port on the same host) since an ALB’s target groups can be associated with ECS-based services directly.
The Hitchhikers Guide to AWS ECS and Docker by J. Cole Morrison is an excellent article for Introduction to AWS ECS concepts.

ECS Tips

Log drivers: ECS supports multiple log drivers (awslogs, splunk, fluentd, syslog, json, ... ). Use awslogs for CloudWatch (make sure a group is made for the logs first). Drivers such as fluentd are not enabled by default. You can, install the agent and enable the driver by adding ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS='[""awslogs"",""fluentd""]' to /etc/ecs/ecs.config.
This blog from Convox (and commentary) lists a number of common challenges with ECS as of early 2016.
It is possible to optimize disk clean up on ECS. By default, the unused containers are deleted after 3 hours and the unused images after 30 minutes. These settings can be changed by adding ECS_ENGINE_TASK_CLEANUP_WAIT_DURATION=10m and ECS_IMAGE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=10m to /etc/ecs/ecs.config. More information on optimizing ECS disk cleanup.

EKS
EKS Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a new service (launched June 2018) that provides managed Kubernetes Masters in a Highly Available pair to deploy K8s Services and Pods on top of EC2 based Kubernetes nodes.
See the Containers and AWS section for more context on containers.
EKS is AWS's solution to hosting Kubernetes natively on AWS. It is not a replacement for ECS directly but is in response to the large market dominance of Kubernetes.
EKS does not launch EC2 nodes and would have to be configured and setup either manually or via Cloudformation (or other automation solution)
EKS management is done through a utility called kubectl, and with Kube configuration files.  These files will need to be configured to speak with the K8s Master with a certificate and URL
EKS authentication is integrated with IAM roles/permissions via a custom plugin for kubectl called aws-iam-authenticator (formerly heptio-authenticator-aws) https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator
EKS provides Calico from Tigera for securing workloads within a cluster using Kubernetes network policy.

EKS Tips

If you do not already have kubectl configured, it is now included in the AWSCLI packages.  This is the simplest way to install kubectl and the assocated iam authenticator plugin

EKS Gotchas and Limitations

Pods and Service configurations can rapidly consume IP addresses inside a VPC.  Proper care and maintenance should be applied to ensure IP exhaustion does not occur
There is currently no integrated monitoring in Cloudwatch for EKS pods or services, you will need to deploy a monitoring system that supports kubernetes such as Prometheus.
Autoscaling based off CPU/Memory of a node is limited as you will not be aware of pending Services/Pods that cannot start. Using cluster-autoscaler can be useful for scaling based on Node resource usage and unschedulable Pods.
Prometheus is a very popular monitoring solution for K8s, metrics and alerts can be used to send events to Lambda, SQS or other solutions to take autoscaling actions.

Fargate allows you to treat containers as fundamental building blocks of your infrastructure

Fargate Tips

Fargate follows a similar mindset to Lambda, which lets you focus on applications, instead of dealing with underlying infrastructure
Fargate is supported by CloudFormation, aws-cli and ecs-cli
Fargate tasks can be launched alongside tasks that use EC2 Launch Type
💸Before creating a large Fargate deployment, make sure to estimate costs and compare them against alternative solution that uses traditional EC2 deployment - Fargate prices can be several times those of equivalently-sized EC2 instances.

Lambda
Lambda Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Lambda is AWS' serverless compute offering, allowing users to define Lambda functions in a selection of runtimes that can be invoked via a variety of triggers, including SNS notifications and API Gateway invocations. Lambda is the key service that enables 'serverless' architecture on AWS, alongside AWS API Gateway, AWS Batch, and AWS DynamoDB.

Lambda Tips

The idea behind 'serverless' is that users don't manage provisioning, scaling, or maintenance of the physical machines that host their application code. With Lambda, the machine that actually executes the user-defined function is abstracted as a 'container'. When defining a Lambda function, users are able to declare the amount of memory available to the function, which directly affects the physical hardware specification of the Lambda container.
Changing the amount of memory available to your Lambda functions also affects the amount of CPU power available to it.
While AWS does not offer hard guarantees around container reuse, in general it can be expected that an unaltered Lambda function will reuse a warm (previously used) container if called shortly after another invocation. Users can use this as a way to optimize their functions by smartly caching application data on initialization.
A Lambda that hasn't been invoked in some time may not have any warm containers left. In this case, the Lambda system will have to load and initialize the Lambda code in a 'cold start' scenario, which can add significant latency to Lambda invocations.
There are a few strategies to avoiding or mitigating cold starts, including keeping containers warm by periodic triggering and favoring lightweight runtimes such as Node as opposed to Java.
Lambda is integrated with AWS CloudWatch and provides a logger at runtime that publishes CloudWatch events.
Lambda offers out-of-the-box opt-in support for AWS X-Ray. X-Ray can help users diagnose Lambda issues by offering in-depth analysis of their Lambda's execution flow. This is especially useful when investigating issues calling other AWS services as X-Ray gives you a detailed and easy-to-parse visualization of the call graph.
Using timed CloudWatch events, users can use Lambda to run periodic jobs in a cron-like manner.
Events sent to Lambda that fail processing can be managed using a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in SQS.

Lambda Alternatives and Lock-in

🚪Other clouds offer similar services with different names, including Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, and IBM OpenWhisk. Also if your are running Kubernetes another Lambda alternative is OpenFaaS

Lambda Gotchas and Limitations

🔸Testing Lambdas, locally and remotely, can be a challenge. Several tools are available to make this easier, including the officially supported SAM Local.
🔸Managing lots of Lambda functions is a workflow challenge, and tooling to manage Lambda deployments is still immature.
🔸AWS’ official workflow around managing function versioning and aliases is painful. One option is to avoid Lambda versioning by abstracting your deployment workflow outside of Lambda. One way this can be accomplished is by deploying your application in successive stages, with a distinct AWS account per stage, where each account only needs to be aware of the latest version, and rollbacks and updates are handled by external tooling.
🔸As of Oct 2017, the minimum charge for a Lambda invocation is 100ms, so there is no cost-benefit to reducing your run time below that.
🔸While adding/removing S3 buckets as triggers for Lambda function, this error may occur: ""There was an error creating the trigger: Configuration is ambiguously defined. Cannot have overlapping suffixes in two rules if the prefixes are overlapping for the same event type."" In this case, you can manually remove the Lambda event in the ""Events"" tab in the ""Properties"" section of the S3 bucket.
🔸Managing the size of your deployment artifact can be a challenge, especially if using Java. Options to mitigate this include proguard and loading dependencies at runtime into /tmp.
When using DynamoDB as a trigger for your Lambda functions, this error may occur: ""PROBLEM: internal Lambda error. Please contact Lambda customer support."" This usually just means that Lambda can't detect anything in the DynamoDB stream within the last 48 hours. If the issue persists, deleting and recreating your trigger may help.
🔸If your lambda needs access to resources in a VPC (for example ElastiCache or RDS), it will need to be deployed within it. This will increase cold-start times as an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) will have to be registered within the VPC for each concurrent function. AWS also has a relatively low initial limit (350) on the number ENI's that can be created within an VPC, however this can be increased to the 1000s if a good case is made to AWS support.
🔸 Lambda has several resource limits as of 2017-06:

A 6MB request or response payload size.
A 50 MB limit on the compressed .zip/.jar file deployment package size.
A 250 MB limit on the code/dependencies in the package before compression.
A 500 MB limit on local storage in /tmp.

This Lambda ECS Worker Pattern shows use of Lambda in a workflow where data from S3 is picked up by the Lambda, pushed to a queue, then sent to ECS for more processing.

API Gateway
API Gateway Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
API Gateway provides a scalable, secured front-end for service APIs, and can work with Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, or regular EC2 services.
It allows “serverless” deployment of applications built with Lambda.
🔸Switching over deployments after upgrades can be tricky. There are no built-in mechanisms to have a single domain name migrate from one API gateway to another one. So it may be necessary to build an additional layer in front (even another API Gateway) to allow smooth migration from one deployment to another.

API Gateway Alternatives and Lock-In

Kong is an open-source, on-premises API and microservices gateway built on nginx with Lua. Kong is extensible through “plugins”.
Tyk is an open-source API gateway implemented in Go and available in the cloud, on-premises or hybrid.

API Gateway Tips

🔹Prior to 2016-11, you could only send and receive plain text data (so people would base64-encode binary data), but binary data is now supported.
API Gateway supports the OpenApi specification (aka Swagger). This allows you to describe your API in a language-agnostic way and use various tools to generate code supporting your API.
Generating clients is extremely easy, either through the AWS console or using the get-sdk API.
API Gateway integrates with CloudWatch out-of-the-box, allowing for easy logging of requests and responses.

Note that if your request or response are too large, CloudWatch will truncate the log. For full request/reply logging, make sure to do so in your integration (e.g. Lambda).
A good practice when calling API Gateway APIs is to log the request ID on the client. You can later refer to these request IDs in CloudWatch for easier tracing and debugging.


There are multiple ways to secure your API, including built-in support for AWS Cognito. For most use-cases, Cognito is the easiest and simplest way to authenticate users.

Although you can roll your own solution using a custom authorizer, which is basically a Lambda you define that determines if a request is acceptable or not.


While API Gateway lends itself well to REST-style development, it's perfectly reasonable to implement an RPC-style API in API Gateway as well. Depending on your use-case, this can often lead to a much simpler API structure and smoother client experience.

RPC-style APIs are particularly useful when designing services that sit deeper in the stack and don't serve content directly to users.



API Gateway Gotchas and Limitations

🔸API Gateway only supports encrypted (https) endpoints, and does not support unencrypted HTTP. (This is probably a good thing.)
🔸API Gateway doesn’t support multi-region deployments for high availability. It is a service that is deployed in a single region but comes with a global endpoint that is served from AWS edge locations (similar to a CloudFront distribution). You cannot have multiple API Gateways with the same hostname in different AWS regions and use Route 53 to distribute the traffic. More in this forum post.
🔸Integration timeout: All of the various integration types (eg: Lambda, HTTP) for API Gateway have timeouts, as described here. Unlike some limits, these timeouts can't be increased.
🔸API Gateway returns a 504 status code for any network or low level transport related issue. When this happens, you may see a message in the CloudWatch logs for the request that includes the message: Execution failed due to an internal error. One possible reason for this error is that even though your backend server is up and running, it may be doing something outside of the HTTP specification (like not sending well-formed chunked messages). You can test by hitting your backend directly with the curl --raw -S -i <backend-endpoint-url> and seeing if it complains.
🔸AWS X-Ray support exists but cumbersome to use. If you have other AWS services calling API Gateway, your trace will seemingly end there. API Gateway will also not appear as a node in your service map. More here.
🔸Be careful using the export feature. The resulting Swagger template is often incomplete and doesn't integrate well with the Swagger extensions for things such as CORS.
🔸Many changes to API Gateway resources need to be 'deployed' via console or API call. Unfortunately, API Gateway is terrible about notifying the user when changes are staged for deployment and what changes require deployment. If you've changed something about your API and it's not taking effect, there's a decent chance you just need to deploy it.

In particular, when deploying an API Gateway as part of a CloudFormation stack, changes will not automatically deploy unless the deployment resource itself was changed. You can change work around this by always changing the deployment resource on a CloudFormation update, or running a custom resource that ensures the deployment is made.
Alternatively, by using the Serverless Application Model definition for an API Gateway resource, you can always expect the API to be deployed on a stack update since SAM will generate a new deployment every time.


🔸API Gateway does not support nested query parameters on method requests.
🔸API Gateway limits number of resources to 300, as described here. This is something to be considered when you start using API Gateway as a platform where your team/organization deploys to the same API Gateway.

Step Functions
Step Functions Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Step Functions is AWS’ way to create state machines that manage a serverless workflow.

Step Functions Tips

A variety of structures are supported including branching, parallel operations and waits
Tasks represent the real work nodes and are frequently Lambda functions, but can be Activities which are externally driven tasks implemented any way you like.
State machines have data that ""flows"" through the steps and can be modified and added to as the state machine executes.
It's best if your tasks are idempotent, in part because you may want to re-run the state machine with the same input data during debugging
The AWS Console facilitates your examining the execution state at various steps.

The console lets you do this with a few steps:

select the ""input"" tab from the failed execution
copy the input data (JSON)
select the state machine name in the breadcrumbs
start a new execution, pasting the input data you copied previously





Step Functions Gotchas and Limitations

Step Functions are free tier eligible up to an initial 4000 transitions per month. Thereafter, the charge is $0.025 per 1000 state transitions.
You can have many, simultaneous, executions, but be aware of lambda throttling limits. This has been per-account, pre-region, but recently became settable per-lambda.
Step Function executions are limited to 25,000 events. Each step creates multiple events. This means that iterating a loop using Lambda is limited to an iteration count of around 3000 before needing to continue as a new execution.

Route 53
Route 53 Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Route 53 is AWS’ DNS service.

Route 53 Alternatives and Lock-In

Historically, AWS was slow to penetrate the DNS market (as it is often driven by perceived reliability and long-term vendor relationships) but Route 53 has matured and is becoming the standard option for many companies. Route 53 is cheap by historic DNS standards, as it has a fairly large global network with geographic DNS and other formerly “premium” features. It’s convenient if you are already using AWS.
⛓Generally you don’t get locked into a DNS provider for simple use cases, but increasingly become tied in once you use specific features like geographic routing or Route 53’s alias records.
🚪Many alternative DNS providers exist, ranging from long-standing premium brands like UltraDNS and Dyn to less well known, more modestly priced brands like DNSMadeEasy. Most DNS experts will tell you that the market is opaque enough that reliability and performance don’t really correlate well with price.
⏱Route 53 is usually somewhere in the middle of the pack on performance tests, e.g. the SolveDNS reports.

Route 53 Tips

🔹Know about Route 53’s “alias” records:

Route 53 supports all the standard DNS record types, but note that alias resource record sets are not standard part of DNS, but a specific Route 53 feature. (It’s available from other DNS providers too, but each provider has a different name for it.)
Aliases are like an internal name (a bit like a CNAME) that is resolved internally on the server side. For example, traditionally you could have a CNAME to the DNS name of a CLB or ALB, but it’s often better to make an alias to the same load balancer. The effect is the same, but in the latter case, externally, all a client sees is the target the record points to.
It’s often wise to use alias record as an alternative to CNAMEs, since they can be updated instantly with an API call, without worrying about DNS propagation.
You can use them for CLBs/ALBs or any other resource where AWS supports it.
Somewhat confusingly, you can have CNAME and A aliases, depending on the type of the target.
Because aliases are extensions to regular DNS records, if exported, the output zone file will have additional non-standard “ALIAS” lines in it.


Latency-based routing allows users around the globe to be automatically directed to the nearest AWS region where you are running, so that latency is reduced.
Understand that domain registration and DNS management (hosted zones) are two separate Route 53 services. When you buy/transfer a domain, Route 53 automatically assigns four name servers to it (e.g. ns-2.awsdns-00.com). Route 53 also offers to automatically create a hosted zone for DNS management, but you are not required do your DNS management in the same account or even in Route 53; you just need to create an NS record pointing to the servers assigned to your domain in Route 53.
One use case would be to put your domain registration (very mission critical) in a bastion account while managing the hosted zones within another account which is accessible by your applications.

Route 53 Gotchas and Limitations

🔸Private Hosted Zone will only respond to DNS queries that originate from within a VPC. As a result Route53 will not respond to request made via a VPN or Direct connect. To get around this you will need to implement Hybrid Cloud DNS Solutions or use the Simple AD provided IP addresses to query the hosted zone.

CloudFormation
CloudFormation Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing at no additional charge
CloudFormation allows you to manage sets of resources from other AWS services grouped into stacks. CloudFormation allows you to define these stacks in a template using JSON or YAML. CloudFormation is one of the major services underpinning AWS' infrastructure as code capabilities and is crucial in enabling repeatable and consistent deployments of infrastructure.
💸CloudFormation itself has no additional charge; you pay for the underlying resources.

CloudFormation Alternatives and Lock-In

Hashicorp’s Terraform is a third-party alternative that can support other cloud platforms/providers including Azure and OpenStack.
🔸Some AWS features may not be available in Terraform (e.g. multi-AZ ElastiCache using Redis), and you may have to resort to embedded CloudFormation templates.
Pulumi enables teams to define and deliver Cloud Native Infrastructure as Code on any cloud, with any language. From containers to serverless to Kubernetes to infrastructure.

CloudFormation Tips

Validate your stack in a different AWS account! CloudFormation truly shines when making multiple deployments of the same stack to different accounts and regions. A common practice is to deploy stacks in successive stages ending in a production rollout.
Avoid potentially time-consuming syntax errors from eating into your deployment time by running validate-template.
CloudFormation is sometimes slow to update what resources (and new features on old services) a user is able to define in the template. If you need to deploy a resource or feature that isn't supported by the template, CloudFormation allows running arbitrary code (using Lambda) on a stack create or update via custom resources.
Custom resources make CloudFormation into a truly powerful tool, as you can do all sorts of neat things quite easily such as sanity tests, initial configuration of Dynamo tables or S3 buckets, cleaning up old CloudWatch logs, etc.

For writing Custom Resources in Java, cfnresponse comes in very handy.
For writing Custom Resources in Javascript, AWS provides a good reference in the documentation.


CloudFormation offers a visual template designer that can be useful when getting up to speed with the template syntax.
By using StackSets, users can define and deploy an entire production application consisting of multiple stacks (one service per stack) in a single CloudFormation template.
If you're developing a serverless application (i.e., using Lambda, API Gateway) CloudFormation offers a simplified template format called SAM.
❗Use a restrictive stack policy! Without one, you can inadvertently delete live production resources, probably causing a severe outage.
❗Turn on termination protection on all of your stacks to avoid costly accidents!
The CloudFormation template reference is indispensable when discovering what is and isn't possible in a CloudFormation template.
Troposphere is a Python library that makes it much easier to create CloudFormation templates.

Currently supports AWS and OpenStack resource types.
Troposphere attempts to support all resources types that can be described in CloudFormation templates.
Built in error checking.
A recommended soft dependency is awacs, which allows you to generate AWS access policy in JSON by writing Python code.


stacker is a Python application that makes it easy to define, configure, orchestrate and manage dependencies for CloudFormation stacks across multiple user-defined environments.
If you are building different stacks with similar layers, it may be useful to build separate templates for each layer that you can reuse using AWS::CloudFormation::Stack.
🔸Avoid hardcoding resource parameters that can potentially change. Use stack parameters as much as you can, and resort to default parameter values.
🔹Until 2016, CloudFormation used only an awkward JSON format that makes both reading and debugging difficult. To use it effectively typically involved building additional tooling, including converting it to YAML, but now this is supported directly.
Wherever possible, export relevant physical IDs from your Stacks by defining Outputs in your CloudFormation Templates. These are the actual names assigned to the resources being created. Outputs can be returned from DescribeStack API calls, and get imported to other Stacks as part of the recent addition of cross-stack references.
-Note that importing outputs in a stack from another stack creates a hard dependency that is tracked by CloudFormation. You will not be able to delete the stack with the outputs until there are no importing stacks.
CloudFormation can be set up to send SNS notifications upon state changes, enabling programmatic handling of situations where stacks fail to build, or simple email alerts so the appropriate people are informed.
CloudFormation allows the use of conditionals when creating a stack.

One common way to leverage this capability is in support of multi-environment CloudFormation templates – by configuring them to use ‘if-else’ statements on the value of a parameter passed in (e.g.  “env”), environment-specific values for things like VPC IDs, SecurityGroup IDs, and AMI names can be passed into reusable generic templates.


Version control your CloudFormation templates! In the Cloud, an application is the combination of the code written and the infrastructure it runs on. By version controlling both, it is easy to roll back to known good states.
Avoid naming your resources explicitly (e.g. DynamoDB tables). When deploying multiple stacks to the same AWS account, these names can come into conflict, potentially slowing down your testing. Prefer using resource references instead.
For things that shouldn't ever be deleted, you can set an explicit DeletionPolicy on the resource that will prevent the resource from being deleted even if the CloudFormation stack itself is deleted. This is useful for anything that can maintain expensive-to-rebuild state, such as DynamoDB tables, and things that are exposed to the outside world, such as API Gateway APIs.

CloudFormation Gotchas and Limitations

🔸A given CloudFormation stack can end up in a wide variety of states. Error reporting is generally weak, and often times multiple observe-tweak-redeploy cycles are needed to get a working template. The internal state machine for all the varying states is extremely opaque.
🔸Some cross-region operations are not possible in CloudFormation without using a custom resource, such as cross-region SNS subscriptions.
🔸While having hand-made resources live alongside CloudFormation-created resources is inadvisable, it's sometimes unavoidable. If at all possible, leave ALL resource management up to a CloudFormation template and only provide read-only access to the console.
❗Modifications to stack resources made outside CloudFormation can potentially lead to stacks stuck in UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED mode. Stacks in this state can be recovered using the continue-update-rollback command. This command can be initiated in the console or in the CLI. The --resources-to-skip parameter usable in the CLI can be useful if the continue-update-rollback command fails. New feature Drift Detection can be used to detect outside changes made to stack.
🔸CloudFormation is useful but complex and with a variety of pain points. Many companies find alternate solutions, and many companies use it, but only with significant additional tooling.
🔸CloudFormation can be very slow, especially for items like CloudFront distributions and Route53 CNAME entries.
🔸It’s hard to assemble good CloudFormation configurations from existing state. AWS does offer a trick to do this, but it’s very clumsy.

CloudFormer also hasn't been updated in ages (as of Oct 2017), doesn't support templatizing many new services, and won't fully define even existing services that have since been updated. For example, Dynamo tables defined through CloudFormer won't contain TTL definitions or auto-scaling configuration.


🔸Many users don’t use CloudFormation at all because of its limitations, or because they find other solutions preferable. Often there are other ways to accomplish the same goals, such as local scripts (Boto, Bash, Ansible, etc.) you manage yourself that build infrastructure, or Docker-based solutions (Convox, etc.).
🔸Deploying large stacks (i.e., many resources) can be problematic due to unintuitive API limits. For instance, API Gateway's CreateDeployment API has a default limit of 3 requests per minute as of 1/12/2018. This limit is readily exceeded even in moderately-sized CloudFormation stacks. Creating CW alarms is another commonly seen limit (PutMetricAlarm, 3 tps as of 1/12/2018) especially when creating many autoscaling policies for DynamoDB. One way to work around this limit is to include CloudFormation 'DependsOn' clauses to artificially chain resource creation.
🔸Creating/deleting stacks can be a little less clean than ideal. Some resources will leave behind traces in your AWS account even after deletion. E.g., Lambda will leave behind CloudWatch log groups that never expire.

VPCs, Network Security, and Security Groups
VPC Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Security groups ∙ Pricing
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is the virtualized networking layer of your AWS systems.
Most AWS users should have a basic understanding of VPC concepts, but few need to get into all the details. VPC configurations can be trivial or extremely complex, depending on the extent of your network and security needs.
All modern AWS accounts (those created after 2013-12-04) are “EC2-VPC” accounts that support VPCs, and all instances will be in a default VPC. Older accounts may still be using “EC2-Classic” mode. Some features don’t work without VPCs, so you probably will want to migrate.

VPC and Network Security Tips


❗Security groups are your first line of defense for your servers. Be extremely restrictive of what ports are open to all incoming connections. In general, if you use CLBs, ALBs or other load balancing, the only ports that need to be open to incoming traffic would be port 22 and whatever port your application uses. Security groups access policy is 'deny by default'.


Port hygiene: A good habit is to pick unique ports within an unusual range for each different kind of production service. For example, your web frontend might use 3010, your backend services 3020 and 3021, and your Postgres instances the usual 5432. Then make sure you have fine-grained security groups for each set of servers. This makes you disciplined about listing out your services, but also is more error-proof. For example, should you accidentally have an extra Apache server running on the default port 80 on a backend server, it will not be exposed.


Migrating from Classic: For migrating from older EC2-Classic deployments to modern EC2-VPC setup, this article may be of help.

You can migrate Elastic IPs between EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC.



For basic AWS use, one default VPC may be sufficient. But as you scale up, you should consider mapping out network topology more thoroughly. A good overview of best practices is here.


Consider controlling access to you private AWS resources through a VPN.

You get better visibility into and control of connection and connection attempts.
You expose a smaller surface area for attack compared to exposing separate (potentially authenticated) services over the public internet.

e.g. A bug in the YAML parser used by the Ruby on Rails admin site is much less serious when the admin site is only visible to the private network and accessed through VPN.


Another common pattern (especially as deployments get larger, security or regulatory requirements get more stringent, or team sizes increase) is to provide a bastion host behind a VPN through which all SSH connections need to transit.
For a cheap VPN to access private AWS resources, consider using a point-to-site software VPN such as OpenVPN. It can either be installed using the official AMI, though you are limited to 2 concurrent users on the free license, or it can be installed using the openvpn package on linux. The linux package allows for unlimited concurrent users but the installation is less straightforward. This OpenVPN installer script can help you install it and add client keys easily.



🔹Consider using other security groups as sources for security group rules instead of using CIDRs — that way, all hosts in the source security group and only hosts in that security group are allowed access. This is a much more dynamic and secure way of managing security group rules.


VPC Flow Logs allow you to monitor the network traffic to, from, and within your VPC. Logs are stored in CloudWatch Logs groups, and can be used for security monitoring (with third party tools), performance evaluation, and forensic investigation.

See the VPC Flow Logs User Guide for basic information.
See the flowlogs-reader CLI tool and Python library to retrieve and work with VPC Flow Logs.



IPv6 is available in VPC. Along with this announcement came the introduction of the Egress-Only Internet Gateway. In cases where one would use NAT Gateways to enable egress-only traffic for their VPC in IPv4, one can use an Egress-Only Internet Gateway for the same purpose in IPv6.


Amazon provides an IPv6 CIDR block for your VPC at your request - at present you cannot implement your own IPv6 block if you happen to own one already.


New and existing VPCs can both use IPv6. Existing VPCs will need to be configured to have an IPv6 CIDR block associated with them, just as new VPCs do.


PrivateLink

📒Homepage ∙ User Guide ∙  Pricing
One of the uses for Private link is Interface VPC Endpoints deploys an ENI into your VPC and subnets which allows you direct access to the AWS API's as if the were accessible locally in your VPC without having to go out to the internet.
Another use case would be to expose a service of your own to other accounts in AWS through a VPC Endpoint Service

VPC and Network Security Gotchas and Limitations

🔸VPCs are tied to one Region in one Account. Subnets are tied to one VPC and limited to one Availability Zone.
🔸Security groups are tied to one VPC. If you are utilizing infrastructure in multiple VPCs you should make sure your configuration/deployment tools take that into account.
🔸VPC Endpoints are currently only available for S3 and DynamoDB. If you have a security requirement to lockdown outbound traffic from your VPC you may want to use DNS filtering to control outbound traffic to other services.
❗Be careful when choosing your VPC IP CIDR block: If you are going to need to make use of ClassicLink, make sure that your private IP range doesn’t overlap with that of EC2 Classic.
❗If you are going to peer VPCs, carefully consider the cost of data transfer between VPCs, since for some workloads and integrations, this can be prohibitively expensive.
❗New RDS instances require a subnet group within your VPC. If you’re using the default VPC this isn’t a concern, it will contain a subnet for each availability zone in your region. However, if you’re creating your own VPC and plan on using RDS, make sure you have at least two subnets within the VPC to act as the subnet group.
❗If you delete the default VPC, you can recreate it via the CLI or the console.
❗Be careful with VPC VPN credentials! If lost or compromised, the VPN endpoint must be deleted and recreated. See the instructions for Replacing Compromised Credentials.
❗Security Groups and Route Tables apply entries separately for IPv4 and IPv6, so one must ensure they add entries for both protocols accordingly.
💸Managed NAT gateways are a convenient alternative to
manually managing NAT instances, but they do come at a cost per gigabyte. Consider alternatives if you're transferring many terabytes from private subnets to the internet.

KMS
KMS Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
KMS (Key Management Service) is a secure service for creating, storing and auditing usage of cryptographic keys.
Service integration: KMS integrates with other AWS services: EBS, Elastic Transcoder, EMR, Redshift, RDS, SES, S3, WorkMail and Workspaces.
Encryption APIs: The Encrypt and Decrypt API allow you to encrypt and decrypt data on the KMS service side, never exposing the master key contents.
Data keys: The GenerateDataKey API generates a new key off of a master key. The data key contents are exposed to you so you can use it to encrypt and decrypt any size of data in your application layer. KMS does not store, manage or track data keys, you are responsible for this in your application.
🔹Auditing: Turn on CloudTrail to audit all KMS API events.
Access: Use key policies and IAM policies to grant different levels of KMS access. For example, you create an IAM policy that only allows a user to encrypt and decrypt with a specific key.

KMS Tips

🔹It’s very common for companies to manage keys completely via home-grown mechanisms, but it’s far preferable to use a service such as KMS from the beginning, as it encourages more secure design and improves policies and processes around managing keys.
A good motivation and overview is in this AWS presentation.
The cryptographic details are in this AWS whitepaper.
This blog from Convox demonstrates why and how to use KMS for encryption at rest.

KMS Gotchas and Limitations

🔸The Encrypt API only works with < 4KB of data. Larger data requires generating and managing a data key in your application layer.
🔸KMS audit events are not available in the CloudTrail Lookup Events API. You need to look find them in the raw .json.gz files that CloudTrail saves in S3.
🔸In order to encrypt a multi-part upload to S3, the KMS Key Policy needs to allow “kms:Decrypt” and “kms:GenerateDataKey*” in addition to “kms:Encrypt”, otherwise the upload will fail with an “AccessDenied” error.
🔸KMS keys are region specific — they are stored and can only be used in the region in which they are created. They can't be transferred to other regions.
🔸KMS keys have a key policy that must grant access to something to manage the key.  If you don't grant anything access to the key on creation, then you have to reach out to support to have the key policy reset Reduce the Risk of the Key Becoming Unmanagable.
🔸If you use a key policy to grant access to IAM roles or users and then delete the user/role, recreating the user or role won't grant them permission to the key again.

CloudFront
CloudFront Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
CloudFront is AWS’ content delivery network (CDN).
Its primary use is improving latency for end users through accessing cacheable content by hosting it at over 60 global edge locations.

CloudFront Alternatives and Lock-in

🚪CDNs are a highly fragmented market. CloudFront has grown to be a leader, but there are many alternatives that might better suit specific needs.

CloudFront Tips

🐥IPv6 is supported. This is a configurable setting, and is enabled by default on new CloudFront distributions. IPv6 support extends to the use of WAF with CloudFront.
🐥HTTP/2 is now supported! Clients must support TLS 1.2 and SNI.
While the most common use is for users to browse and download content (GET or HEAD methods) requests, CloudFront also supports (since 2013) uploaded data (POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and PATCH).

You must enable this by specifying the allowed HTTP methods when you create the distribution.
Interestingly, the cost of accepting (uploaded) data is usually less than for sending (downloaded) data.


In its basic version, CloudFront supports SSL via the SNI extension to TLS, which is supported by all modern web browsers. If you need to support older browsers, you need to pay a few hundred dollars a month for dedicated IPs.

💸⏱Consider invalidation needs carefully. CloudFront does support invalidation of objects from edge locations, but this typically takes many minutes to propagate to edge locations, and costs $0.005 per request after the first 1000 requests. (Some other CDNs support this better.)


Everyone should use TLS nowadays if possible. Ilya Grigorik’s table offers a good summary of features regarding TLS performance features of CloudFront.
An alternative to invalidation that is often easier to manage, and instant, is to configure the distribution to cache with query strings and then append unique query strings with versions onto assets that are updated frequently.
⏱For good web performance, it is recommended to enable compression on CloudFront distributions if the origin is S3 or another source that does not already compress.

CloudFront Gotchas and Limitations

🔸If using S3 as a backing store, remember that the endpoints for website hosting and for general S3 are different. Example: “bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com” is a standard S3 serving endpoint, but to have redirect and error page support, you need to use the website hosting endpoint listed for that bucket, e.g. “bucketname.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com” (or the appropriate region).
🔸By default, CloudFront will not forward HTTP Host: headers through to your origin servers. This can be problematic for your origin if you run multiple sites switched with host headers. You can enable host header forwarding in the default cache behavior settings.
🔸4096-bit SSL certificates: CloudFront do not support 4096-bit SSL certificates as of late 2016. If you are using an externally issued SSL certificate, you’ll need to make sure it’s 2048 bits. See ongoing discussion.
Although connections from clients to CloudFront edge servers can make use of IPv6, connections to the origin server will continue to use IPv4.

DirectConnect
DirectConnect Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Direct Connect is a private, dedicated connection from your network(s) to AWS.

DirectConnect Tips

If your data center has a partnering relationship with AWS, setup is streamlined.
Use for more consistent predictable network performance guarantees (1 Gbps or 10 Gbps per link).
Use to peer your colocation, corporate, or physical datacenter network with your VPC(s).

Example: Extend corporate LDAP and/or Kerberos to EC2 instances running in a VPC.
Example: Make services that are hosted outside of AWS for financial, regulatory, or legacy reasons callable from within a VPC.



Redshift
Redshift Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Redshift is AWS’ managed data warehouse solution, which is massively parallel, scalable, and columnar. It is very widely used. It was built using ParAccel technology and exposes Postgres-compatible interfaces.

Redshift Alternatives and Lock-in

⛓🚪Whatever data warehouse you select, your business will likely be locked in for a long time. Also (and not coincidentally) the data warehouse market is highly fragmented. Selecting a data warehouse is a choice to be made carefully, with research and awareness of the market landscape and what business intelligence tools you’ll be using.

Redshift Tips

Although Redshift is mostly Postgres-compatible, its SQL dialect and performance profile are different.
Redshift supports only 12 primitive data types. (List of unsupported Postgres types)
It has a leader node and computation nodes (the leader node distributes queries to the computation ones). Note that some functions can be executed only on the lead node.
🔹Make sure to create a new cluster parameter group and option group for your database since the default parameter group does not allow dynamic configuration changes.
Major third-party BI tools support Redshift integration (see Quora).
Top 10 Performance Tuning Techniques for Amazon Redshift provides an excellent list of performance tuning techniques.
Amazon Redshift Utils contains useful utilities, scripts and views to simplify Redshift ops.
VACUUM regularly following a significant number of deletes or updates to reclaim space and improve query performance.
Avoid performing blanket VACUUM or ANALYZE operations at a cluster level. The checks on each table to determine whether VACUUM or ANALYZE action needs to be taken is wasteful. Only perform ANALYZE and VACUUM commands on the objects that require it. Utilize the Analyze & Vacuum Schema Utility to perform this work. The SQL to determine whether a table needs to be VACUUMed or ANALYZEd can be found in the Schema Utility README if you wish to create your own maintenance process.
Redshift provides various column compression options to optimize the stored data size. AWS strongly encourages users to use automatic compression at the COPY stage, when Redshift uses a sample of the data being ingested to analyze the column compression options. However, automatic compression can only be applied to an empty table with no data. Therefore, make sure the initial load batch is big enough to provide Redshift with a representative sample of the data (the default sample size is 100,000 rows).
Redshift uses columnar storage, hence it does not have indexing capabilities. You can, however, use distribution key and sortkey to improve performance. Redshift has two types of sort keys: compounding sort key and interleaved sort key.
A compound sort key is made up of all columns listed in the sort key definition. It is most useful when you have queries with operations using the prefix of the sortkey.
An interleaved sort key on the other hand gives equal weight to each column or a subset of columns in the sort key. So if you don't know ahead of time which column(s) you want to choose for sorting and filtering, this is a much better choice than the compound key. Here is an example using interleaved sort key.
🔸⏱ Distribution strategies: Since data in Redshift is physically distributed among nodes, choosing the right data distribution key and distribution style is crucial for adequate query performance. There are three possible distribution style settings — EVEN (the default), KEY, or ALL. Use KEY to collocate join key columns for tables which are joined in queries. Use ALL to place the data in small-sized tables on all cluster nodes.

Redshift Gotchas and Limitations

❗⏱While Redshift can handle heavy queries well, it does not scale horizontally, i.e. does not handle multiple queries in parallel. Therefore, if you expect a high parallel load, consider replicating or (if possible) sharding your data across multiple clusters.
🔸 The leader node, which manages communications with client programs and all communication with compute nodes, is the single point of failure.
⏱Although most Redshift queries parallelize well at the compute node level, certain stages are executed on the leader node, which can become the bottleneck.
🔹Redshift data commit transactions are very expensive and serialized at the cluster level. Therefore, consider grouping multiple mutation commands (COPY/INSERT/UPDATE) commands into a single transaction whenever possible.
🔹Redshift does not support multi-AZ deployments. Building multi-AZ clusters is not trivial. Here is an example using Kinesis.
🔸Beware of storing multiple small tables in Redshift. The way Redshift tables are laid out on disk makes it impractical. The minimum space required to store a table (in MB) is nodes * slices/node * columns. For example, on a 16 node cluster an empty table with 20 columns will occupy 640MB on disk.
⏱ Query performance degrades significantly during data ingestion. WLM (Workload Management) tweaks help to some extent. However, if you need consistent read performance, consider having replica clusters (at the extra cost) and swap them during update.
❗ Never resize a live cluster. The resize operation can take hours depending on the dataset size. In rare cases, the operation may also get stuck and you'll end up having a non-functional cluster. The safer approach is to create a new cluster from a snapshot, resize the new cluster and shut down the old one.
🔸Redshift has reserved keywords that are not present in Postgres (see full list here). Watch out for DELTA (Delta Encodings).
🔸Redshift does not support many Postgres functions, most notably several date/time-related and aggregation functions. See the full list here.
🔸 Uniqueness, primary key, and foreign key constraints on Redshift tables are informational only and are not enforced. They are, however, used by the query optimizer to generate query plans. NOT NULL column constraints are enforced. See here for more information on defining constraints.
🔸Compression on sort key can result in significant performance impact. So if your Redshift queries involving sort key(s) are slow, you might want to consider removing compression on a sort key.
🔹 Choosing a sort key is very important since you can not change a table’s sort key after it is created. If you need to change the sort or distribution key of a table, you need to create a new table with the new key and move your data into it with a query like “insert into new_table select * from old_table”.
❗🚪 When moving data with a query that looks like “insert into x select from y”, you need to have twice as much disk space available as table “y” takes up on the cluster’s disks. Redshift first copies the data to disk and then to the new table. Here is a good article on how to this for big tables.

EMR
EMR Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Release guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
EMR (which used to stand for Elastic Map Reduce, but not anymore, since it now extends beyond map-reduce) is a service that offers managed deployment of Hadoop, HBase and Spark. It reduces the management burden of setting up and maintaining these services yourself.

EMR Alternatives and Lock-in

⛓Most of EMR is based on open source technology that you can in principle deploy yourself. However, the job workflows and much other tooling is AWS-specific. Migrating from EMR to your own clusters is possible but not always trivial.

EMR Tips

EMR relies on many versions of Hadoop and other supporting software. Be sure to check which versions are in use.
⏱Off-the-shelf EMR and Hadoop can have significant overhead when compared with efficient processing on a single machine. If your data is small and performance matters, you may wish to consider alternatives, as this post illustrates.
Python programmers may want to take a look at Yelp’s mrjob.
It takes time to tune performance of EMR jobs, which is why third-party services such as Qubole’s data service are gaining popularity as ways to improve performance or reduce costs.

EMR Gotchas and Limitations

💸❗EMR costs can pile up quickly since it involves lots of instances, efficiency can be poor depending on cluster configuration and choice of workload, and accidents like hung jobs are costly. See the section on EC2 cost management, especially the tips there about Spot instances. This blog post has additional tips, but was written prior to the shift to per-second billing.
💸 Beware of “double-dipping”. With EMR, you pay for the EC2 capacity and the service fees. In addition, EMR syncs task logs to S3, which means you pay for the storage and PUT requests at S3 standard rates. While the log files tend to be relatively small, every Hadoop job, depending on the size, generates thousands of log files that can quickly add up to thousands of dollars on the AWS bill. YARN’s log aggregation is not available on EMR.

Kinesis Streams
Kinesis Streams Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Kinesis Streams (which used to be only called Kinesis, before Kinesis Firehose and Kinesis Analytics were launched) is a service that allows you to ingest high-throughput data streams for immediate or delayed processing by other AWS services.
Kinesis Streams’ subcomponents are called shards. Each shard provides 1MB/s of write capacity and 2MB/s of read capacity at a maximum of 5 reads per second. A stream can have its shards programmatically increased or decreased based on a variety of metrics.
All records entered into a Kinesis Stream are assigned a unique sequence number as they are captured. The records in a Stream are ordered by this number, so any time-ordering is preserved.
This page summarizes key terms and concepts for Kinesis Streams.

Kinesis Streams Alternatives and Lock-in

🚪 Kinesis is most closely compared to Apache Kafka, an open-source data ingestion solution. It is possible to set up a Kafka cluster hosted on EC2 instances (or any other VPS), however you are responsible for managing and maintaining both Zookeeper and the Kafka brokers in a highly available configuration. Confluent has a good blog post with their recommendations on how to do this here, which has links on the bottom to several other blogs they have written on the subject.
⛓ Kinesis uses very AWS-specific APIs, so you should be aware of the potential future costs of migrating away from it, should you choose to use it.
An application that efficiently uses Kinesis Streams will scale the number of shards up and down based on the required streaming capacity. (Note there is no direct equivalent to this with Apache Kafka.)

Kinesis Streams Tips

The KCL (Kinesis Client Library) provides a skeleton interface for Java, Node, Python, Ruby and .NET programs to easily consume data from a Kinesis Stream. In order to start consuming data from a Stream, you only need to provide a config file to point at the correct Kinesis Stream, and functions for initialising the consumer, processing the records, and shutting down the consumer within the skeletons provided.

The KCL uses a DynamoDB table to keep track of which records have been processed by the KCL. This ensures that all records are processed “at least once”. It is up to the developer to ensure that the program can handle doubly-processed records.
The KCL also uses DynamoDB to keep track of other KCL “workers”. It automatically shares the available Kinesis Shards across all the workers as equally as possible.



Kinesis Streams Gotchas and Limitations

🔸⏱  Kinesis Streams’ shards each only permit 5 reads per second. If you are evenly distributing data across many shards, your read limit for the Stream will remain at 5 reads per second on aggregate, as each consuming application will need to check every single shard for new records. This puts a hard limit on the number of different consuming applications possible per Stream for a given maximum read latency.

For example, if you have 5 consuming applications reading data from one Stream with any number of shards, they cannot read with a latency of less than one second, as each of the 5 consumers will need to poll each shard every second, reaching the cap of 5 reads per second per shard.
This blog post further discusses the performance and limitations of Kinesis in production.


💸 Kinesis Streams are not included in the free tier. Make sure if you do any experimentation with it on a personal account, you shut down the stream or it may run up unexpected costs (~$11 per shard-month.)

Kinesis Firehose
Kinesis Firehose Gotchas and Limitations

🔸 📜 When delivering from Firehose to Elasticsearch, the JSON document cannot contain an “_id” property. Firehose will not attempt to deliver those documents and won't log any error.

Device Farm
Device Farm Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Developer guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Device Farm is an AWS service that enables mobile app testing on real devices.
Supports iOS and Android (including Kindle Fire) devices, as well as the mobile web.
Supports remote device access in order to allow for interactive testing/debugging.

Device Farm Tips

AWS Mobile blog contains several examples of Device Farm usage for testing.
Device Farm offers a free trial for users who want to evaluate their service.
Device Farm offers two pricing models: Paying per device minute is useful for small usage levels or for situations where it‘s hard to predict usage amount. Unmetered plans are useful in situations where active usage is expected from the beginning.
To minimize waiting time for device availability, one approach is to create several device pools with different devices, then randomly choose one of the unused device pools on every run.

Device Farm Gotchas and Limitations

❗Devices don't have a SIM card and therefore can‘t be used for testing SIM card-related features.
🔸Device Farm supports testing for most popular languages/frameworks, but not for all. An actual list of supported frameworks and languages is presented on this page.
🔸The API and CLI for Device Farm is quite a low level and may require developing additional tools or scripts on top of it.
🔸AWS provide several tools and plugins for Device Farm, however, it doesn‘t cover all cases or platforms. It may require developing specific tools or plugins to support specific requirements.
❗In general, Device Farm doesn‘t have Android devices from Chinese companies like Huawei, Meizu, Lenovo, etc. An actual list of supported devices located here.
🔸Device availibility is uneven. It depends on several factors including device popularity. Usually, more modern devices see higher demand, thus the waiting time for them will be higher compared to relatively old devices.

IoT
IoT Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing


IoT is a platform for allowing clients such as IoT devices or software applications (examples) to communicate with the AWS cloud.
Clients are also called devices (or things) and include a wide variety of device types.  Roughly there are three categories of device types that interact with IoT services by sending message over an IoT protocol to the IoT Pub/Sub-style message broker, which is called the IoT Device Gateway:

Send messages only: For example, the AWS IoT Button on an eddystone beacon.
Send, receive, and process messages: For example, a simple processing board, such as a Raspberry Pi (quick start guide), or an AWS device, such as Echo or Echo Dot, which are designed to work with the AWS Alexa skills kit (a programmable voice-enabled service from AWS).


AWS has a useful quick-start (using the Console) and a slide presentation on core topics.


IoT terms:

AWS IoT Things (metadata for devices in a registry) and can store device state in a JSON document, which is called a device shadow.  Device metadata can also be stored in IoT Thing Types. This aids in device metadata management by allowing for reuse of device description and configuration for more than one device.  Note that IoT Thing Types can be deprecated, but not changed — they are immutable.
AWS IoT Certificates (device authentication) are the logical association of a unique certificate to the logical representation of a device. This association can be done in the Console.  In addition, the public key of the certificate must be copied to the physical device. This covers the authentication of devices to a particular AWS Device Gateway (or message broker). You can associate an AWS IoT certificate with an IoT device or you can register your own CA (Certificate Authority) with AWS, generate your own certificate(s) and associate those certificates with your devices via the AWS Console or cli.
AWS IoT Policies (device/topic authorization) are JSON files that are associated to one or more AWS IoT certificates. This authorizes associated devices to publish and/or subscribe to messages from one or more MQTT topics.
AWS IoT Rules are SQL-like queries which allows for reuse of some or all device message data, as described in this presentation, which summarizes design patterns with for IoT Rules.
Shown below is a diagram which summarizes the flow of messages between the AWS IoT services:




IoT Greengrass

📒 Homepage
🐥Greengrass is a software platform that extends AWS IoT capabilities allowing Lambda functions to be run directly on local devices.  It also enables IoT devices to be able to securely communicate on a local network without having to connect to the cloud.

Greengrass includes a local pub/sub message manager that can buffer messages if connectivity is lost so that inbound and outbound messages to the cloud are preserved. Locally deployed Lambda functions can be triggered by local events, messages from the cloud, or other sources.
Greengrass includes secure authentication and authorization of devices within the local network and also between the local network and the AWS cloud. It also provides secure, over-the-air software updates of Lambda functions.


Greengrass core software includes a message manager object, Lambda runtime, local copy service for IoT Thing (or device) shadows, and a deployment agent to manage Greengrass group configuration.
Greengrass groups are containers for selected IoT devices settings, subscriptions and associated Lambda functions.  In a Greengrass group a device is either a Greengrass core or an IoT device which will be connected that particular Greengrass core.
The Greengrass core SDK enables Lambda functions to interact with the AWS Greengrass core on which they run in order to publish messages, interact with the local Thing Shadows service, or invoke other deployed Lambda functions.
The AWS Greengrass Core SDK only supports sending MQTT messages with QoS = 0.
Shown below is a diagram which shows the architecture of AWS IoT Greengrass services:

AWS, Microsoft and Google have all introduced IoT-specific sets of cloud services since late 2015. AWS was first, moving their IoT services to general availability in Dec 2015. Microsoft released their set of IoT services for Azure in Feb 2016.  Google has only previewed, but not released their IoT services Android Things and Weave.
Issues of lock-in center around your devices —  protocols (for example MQTT, AMQP), message formats (such as, JSON vs. Hex...) and security (certificates).

IoT Tips

Getting started with Buttons: One way to start is to use an AWS IoT Button.  AWS provides a number of code samples for use with their IoT Button, you can use the AWS IoT console, click the “connect AWS IoT button” link and you'll be taken to the  AWS Lambda console.  There you fill out your button’s serial number to associate it with a Lambda. (As of this writing, AWS IoT buttons are only available for sale in the US.)
Connections and protocols: It is important to understand the details of about the devices you wish to connect to the AWS IoT service, including how you will secure the device connections, the device protocols, and more. Cloud vendors differ significantly in their support for common IoT protocols, such as MQTT, AMQP, XMPP. AWS IoT supports secure MQTT, WebSockets and HTTPS.
Support for device security via certificate processing is a key differentiator in this space.  In August 2016, AWS added just-in-time registrations for IoT devices to their services.
Combining with other services: It’s common to use other AWS services, such as AWS Lambda, Kinesis and DynamoDB, although this is by no means required.  Sample IoT application reference architectures are in this screencast.
Testing tools:

To get started, AWS includes a lightweight MQTT client in the AWS IoT console. Here you can create and test sending and receiving messages to and from various MQTT topics.
When testing locally, if using MQTT, it may be helpful to download and use the open source Mosquitto broker tool for local testing with devices and/or device simulators
Use this MQTT load simulator to test device message load throughout your IoT solution.



IoT Gotchas and Limitations

🔸IoT protocols: It is important to verify the exact type of support for your particular IoT device message protocol. For example, one commonly used IoT protocol is MQTT. Within MQTT there are three possible levels of QoS in MQTT.  AWS IoT supports MQTT QoS 0 (fire and forget, or at most once) and QoS 1(at least once, or includes confirmation), but not QoS 2 (exactly once, requires 4-step confirmation).  This is important in understanding how much code you’ll need to write for your particular application message resolution needs.  Here is a presentation about the nuances of connecting.
🔸The ecosystems to match IAM users or roles to IoT policies and their associated authorized AWS IoT devices are immature. Custom coding to enforce your security requirements is common.
❗A common mistake is to misunderstand the importance of IoT device security.  It is imperative to associate each device with a unique certificate (public key). You can generate your own certificates and upload them to AWS, or you can use AWS generated IoT device certificates. It’s best to read and understand AWS’s own guidance on this topic.
🔸There is only one AWS IoT Gateway (endpoint) per AWS account. For production scenarios, you’ll probably need to set up multiple AWS accounts in order to separate device traffic for development, test and production. It’s interesting to note that the Azure IoT Gateway supports configuration of multiple endpoints, so that a single Azure account can be used with separate pub/sub endpoints for development, testing and production
🔸Limits: Be aware of limits, including device message size, type, frequency, and number of AWS IoT rules.

IoT Code Samples

Simple Beer Service is a surprisingly useful code example using AWS IoT, Lambda, etc.
IoT-elf offers clean Python sample using the AWS IoT SDK.
IoT Button projects on Hackster include many different code samples for projects.
5 IoT code examples: a device simulator, MQTT sample, just in time registration, truck simulator, prediction data simulator.
AWS Alexa trivia voice example is a quick-start using Alexa voice capability and Lambda.
Some Raspberry Pi examples include the Beacon project, Danbo, and GoPiGo.

SES
SES Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Documentation ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
SES (or Simple Email Service) is a service that exposes SMTP endpoints for your application to directly integrate with.

SES Tips

🔹Bounce Handling: Make sure you handle this early enough. Your ability to send emails can be removed if SES sees too many bounces.
🔹Credentials: Many developers get confused between SES credentials and AWS API keys. Make sure to enter SMTP credentials while using the SMTP APIs.

SES Gotchas and Limitations

🔸Internet Access: SES SMTP endpoints are on the Internet and will not be accessible from a location without Internet access (e.g. a private subnet without NAT gateway route in the routing table). In such a case, set up an SMTP relay instance in a subnet with Internet access and configure your application to send emails to this SMTP relay instance rather than SES. The relay should have a forwarding rule to send all emails to SES). ❗If you are using a proxy instead of a NAT, confirm that your proxy service supports SMTP.

Certificate Manager
Certificate Manager Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ User guide ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
Use the Certificate Manager to manage SSL/TLS certificates in other AWS services.
Supports importing existing certificates as well as issuing new ones.
Provides Domain Validated (DV) certificates. Validation is done by sending an email to 3 contact addresses in WHOIS and 5 common addresses for the domain, for each domain name present in the request. As of late 2017, this can also be done via DNS instead.
ACM will attempt to automatically renew a certificate issued by Amazon. It will first attempt to connect to the domain on HTTPS and check that the certificate used by the domain is the same with the certificate that it intends to renew. Failing that, it will check the DNS record used previously for validation. Failing that, ACM will attempt manual validation by sending emails to all domains in the certificate.

Certificate Manager Alternatives and Lock-in

⛓Certificates issued by the Certificate Manager can’t be used outside of the services that support it. Imported certificates, however, can still be used elsewhere.

Certificate Manager Tips

🔹Supported services: Managed Load Balancers, CloudFront, API Gateway and Elastic Beanstalk.
🔸During the domain validation process, if DNS validation is unsuccessful Certificate Manager will send an email to every contact address specified in the domain’s WHOIS record and up to five common administrative addresses. Some anti-spam filters can mark emails as spam because of this. You should check the spam folder of your email if you don’t receive a confirmation email.
🔹 Setting up a certificate for a test domain you don't have email set up on? You can now use DNS validation instead.
🔹Remember when requesting a wildcard domain that the request will not be valid for the level just below the wildcard, or any subdomains preceding the wildcard. Take for example an approved, issued certificate for *.bar.example.com. This would be valid for foo.bar.example.com but not bar.example.com. Likewise it would also not be valid for www.bar.foo.example.com. You would need to add each of these domains to the certificate request.

Certificate Manager Gotchas and Limitations

🔸In order to use Certificate Manager for CloudFront distributions, the certificate must be issued or imported from us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region.
🔸Certificates used with Elastic Load Balancers must be issued in the same region as the load balancer. Certificates can not be moved or copied between regions, as of July 2017. If a domain uses load balancers present in multiple regions, a different certificate must be requested for each region.
🔸IoT has its own way of setting up certificates.
🔸By default the maximum number of domains per certificate is 10. You can get this limit increased to a maximum of 100 by contacting AWS support. Note for every different domain you have on the requested cert, you'll need to press accept on an email sent to that domain. For example if you request a cert with 42 different domains or sub domains, you'll need to press accept on 42 different links.

🔹If you request a limit increase to AWS support for this, they will respond to you asking to confirm this. Bypass this by saying in the body of your initial request:
""I acknowledge at the moment, there is no method to add or remove a name from a certificate. Instead, you must request a new certificate with the revised namelist and you must then re-approve all of the names in the certificate, even if they'd been previously approved.""


🔸There is no way at the moment to add or remove a domain to/from an existing certificate. You must request a new certificate and re-approve it from each of the domains requested.

WAF

OpsWorks
OpsWorks Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Documentation ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing: Stacks, Chef Automate, Puppet Enterprise
OpsWorks is a configuration management service that uses Chef or Puppet configuration management. It is broken out into three different services:

OpsWorks Stacks: The service lets you configure and launch stacks specific to your application's needs, and allows you to automate application deployments. Chef runs can be performed manually via the Execute Cookbooks command, otherwise they are only run as part of lifecycle events.

OpsWorks Stacks differs from standard configuration management services in that it also allows you to perform some infrastructure and application automation (such as creating Amazon EC2 instances and deploying applications via Chef cookbooks).


OpsWorks for Chef Automate: This service launches a dedicated Chef Automate server in your account, which can be used to associate nodes, upload coobook code, and configure systems. Automated patching, backups, OS updates, and minor Chef version upgrades are provided as part of the service. An AWS API is provided for associating/disassociating nodes. Chef runs can be scheduled on nodes using the chef-client cookbook.
OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise: This service launches a dedicated Puppet Master in your account, which can be used to associate nodes, upload modules, and configure systems. Automated patching, backups, OS updates, and minor Puppet version upgrades are provided as part of the service. An AWS API is provided for associating/disassociating nodes. By default, the Puppet agent will run automatically every 30 minutes on associated nodes.


OpsWorks for Chef Automate and OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise are strictly designed for configuration management, and do not provision infrastructure outside the Chef Server/Puppet Master that is created in our account.
All three OpsWorks services support managing both Amazon EC2 and on-premises infrastructure, however the implementation details differ slightly.

OpsWorks Stacks allows you to register instances and install the OpsWorks Agent to connect to your stack.
OpsWorks for Chef Automate and OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise allow you to associate new or existing infrastructure using either the opsworks-cm:AssociateNode API action or the vendor-supported method for associating nodes to Chef Server or Puppet Enterprise.


Although OpsWorks will let you work with common Chef recipes or Puppet modules when creating your stacks, creating custom recipes will require familiarity with Chef or Puppet syntax. Chef/Puppet code is not supported as part of AWS Support.
As of December 2016, OpsWorks Stacks supports Chef versions 12, 11.10.4, 11.4.4 and 0.9.15.5.
As of December 2016, OpsWorks for Chef Automate uses Chef Server version 12.11.1 This is the current stable version of Chef.
Berkshelfcan be used  with Chef stacks of version 11.10 and later for managing cookbooks and their respective dependencies. However, on Chef 12.x stacks, Berkshelf must be installed by the stack administrator.
Running your own Chef environment may be an alternative to consider - some considerations are listed in this Bitlancer article.

OpsWorks Alternatives and Lock-in

Major competitors in Configuration Management include:

Chef
Puppet
Ansible.



OpsWorks Tips

OpsWorks Stacks and OpsWorks for Chef Automate use Chef cookbooks for configuration. Chef provides free training to learn syntax, best practices, etc. at https://learn.chef.io.
OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise uses Puppet manifests for configuration. Puppet provides a very useful learning VM for download at https://learn.puppet.com/.

OpsWorks Gotchas and Limitations

OpsWorks Stacks is not available in the following regions:

Montreal
GovCloud
Beijing


OpsWorks for Chef Automate and OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise are not available in the following regions:

Batch
Batch Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Documentation ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
AWS Batch is a service that offers an environment to run batch computing jobs. The service dynamically provisions the optimal compute resources needed by the jobs based on their resource requirements, and can scale up to hundreds of thousands of jobs.
These batch workloads have access to all other AWS services and features.
AWS Batch, coupled with spot instances can help run the jobs when appropriate capacity is available, providing for optimal utilization of compute resources.
The batch workloads are built as a Docker Image. These images can then pushed to the EC2 Container Registry (ECR), or any private repository that can be accessed from AWS.
A Job Definition has the workload's Docker Image URI, and also lets the users specify the environment details like vCPUs, memory, volume mappings, environment variables, parameters, retry strategy, container properties, and the job's IAM role.
The Compute Environments are EC2 clusters that provide the runtime for the batch workloads to execute in.
AWS Batch provides managed, as well as unmanaged compute environments. The Managed Environments are provisioned and managed by AWS, while the Unmanaged Environments are managed by the customers.
The Job Definitions are submitted to Job Queue(s) for execution. Each queue has a priority, and has at least one Compute Environment associated with it.
AWS Batch uses ECS to execute the containerized jobs.

Batch Tips

AWS Batch supports prioritization of jobs via the Job Queue Priority. Higher the number - higher the priority.
AWS Batch supports launching the Compute Environment into specific VPC and subnets.
A Compute Environment is same as an ECS Cluster.
There is no additional cost for AWS Batch. You only pay the cost associated with the AWS Services being used - like EC2 Instances and any resources consumed by the batch jobs.
Associate IAM Roles and policies with the Compute Environment to enable the containers access to other AWS resources.
🔹 Use Unmanaged Compute Environments if you need specialized resources like Dedicated Hosts, or EFS.

SQS
SQS Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Documentation ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing 
SQS is a highly scalable, fully managed message queuing service from AWS.
SQS supports the pull model, where the producers queue the messages, and the consumers pull messages off the queue.
SQS provides a message visibility timeout, during which the message being processed will not be delivered to other consumers. If the consumer does not delete the message after processing, the message becomes available to other consumers upon reaching the message visibility timeout. This parameter is called VisibilityTimeout.
Each message can have up to 10 custom fields, or attributes.
SQS allows producers to set up to 15 minutes of delay before the messages are delivered to the consumers. This parameter is called DelaySeconds.
There are two types of queues supported by SQS -

Standard Queues

Guarantee at least once delivery of the messages.
Do not retain the order of delivery of the messages.


FIFO Queues

Guarantee only once delivery of the messages
Guarantee the order of the delivery of the messages




SQS supports fine grained access to various API calls and Queues via IAM policies.
The messages that fail to process can be put in a dead letter queue.

SQS Alternatives and Lock-In

Alternatives to SQS include Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ and others.
Google Cloud Platform has Pub/Sub, and Azure has Azure Queue Service.
SQS vs SNS

SQS Tips

SNS can be used in combination of SQS to build a “fan out” mechanism by having an SQS Queue subscribe to the SNS topic.
SQS supports encryption using AWS KMS.
Cloudwatch alarms can be creating using various SQS metrics to trigger autoscaling actions and/or notifications.

SQS Gotchas and Limitations

🔸 SQS does not have a VPC endpoint (unlike S3 and DynamoDB), so SQS will need to be accessed using public SQS API endpoints.
🔸 FIFO Queues are limited to 300 API calls per second.
🔸 FIFO Queues cannot subscribe to an SNS topic.
🔸 Standard Queues can deliver duplicate messages regardless of the visibility window. If only-once delivery is your only choice, then use FIFO queues, or build an additional layer to de-dupe the messages.
🔸 You can send/receive messages in batch, however, there can only be maximum of 10 messages in a batch.

SNS
SNS Basics

📒 Homepage ∙ Documentation ∙ FAQ ∙ Pricing
SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a pub/sub based, highly scalable, and fully managed messaging service that can also be used for mobile notifications.
SNS can push the messages down to the subscribers via SMS, Email, SQS, and HTTP/S transport protocols.
Producers publish messages to a SNS Topics, which can have many subscribers.
Each subscription has an associated protocol, which is used to notify the subscriber.
A copy of the message is sent to each subscriber using the associated protocol.
SNS can also invoke lambda functions.

SNS Alternatives and Lock-In

Popular alternatives to SNS are Kafka, Notification Hubs on Azure, and Pub/Sub on Google Cloud.
SNS vs SQS:

Both SNS and SQS are highly scalable, fully managed messaging services provided by AWS.
SQS supports a pull model, while SNS supports a push model. Consumers have to pull messages from an SQS Queue, while they're pushed the message from an SNS Topic.
An SQS message is intended to be processed by only one subscriber, while SNS topics can have many subscribers.
After processing, the SQS message is deleted from the queue by the subscriber to avoid being re-processed.
An SNS message is pushed to all subscribers of the topic at the same time, and is not available for deletion at the topic.
SNS supports multiple transport protocols of delivery of the messages to the subscribers, while SQS subscribers have to pull the messages off the queue over HTTPS.



SNS Tips

Fan-out architecture can be achieved by having multiple subscribers for a topic. This is particularly useful when events have to be fanned out to multiple, isolated systems.
SNS topics can be used to power webhooks with backoff support to subscribers over HTTP/S.
SQS queues can subscribe to SNS topics.
SNS is used to manage notifications for other AWS services like Autoscaling Groups' notifications, CloudWatch Alarms, etc.
SNS is frequently used as “glue” between disparate systems— such as GitHub and AWS services.

SNS Gotchas and Limitations

🔸 HTTP/S subscribers of SNS topics need to have public endpoints, as SNS does not support calling private endpoints (like those in a private subnet within a VPC).
📜 In a fan-out scenario, SSE-enabled SQS subscribers of an SNS topic will not receive the messages sent to the topic.

High Availability
This section covers tips and information on achieving high availability.
High Availability Tips

AWS offers two levels of redundancy, regions and availability zones (AZs).
When used correctly, regions and zones do allow for high availability. You may want to use non-AWS providers for larger business risk mitigation (i.e. not tying your company to one vendor), but reliability of AWS across regions is very high.
Multiple regions: Using multiple regions is complex, since it’s essentially like managing completely separate infrastructures. It is necessary for business-critical services with the highest levels of redundancy. However, for many applications (like your average consumer startup), deploying extensive redundancy across regions may be overkill.
The High Scalability Blog has a good guide to help you understand when you need to scale an application to multiple regions.
🔹Multiple AZs: Using AZs wisely is the primary tool for high availability!

A typical single-region high availability architecture would be to deploy in two or more availability zones, with load balancing in front, as in this AWS diagram.
The bulk of outages in AWS services affect one zone only. There have been rare outages affecting multiple zones simultaneously (for example, the great EBS failure of 2011) but in general most customers’ outages are due to using only a single AZ for some infrastructure.
Consequently, design your architecture to minimize the impact of AZ outages, especially single-zone outages.
Deploy key infrastructure across at least two or three AZs. Replicating a single resource across more than three zones often won’t make sense if you have other backup mechanisms in place, like S3 snapshots.
A second or third AZ should significantly improve availability, but additional reliability of 4 or more AZs may not justify the costs or complexity (unless you have other reasons like capacity or Spot market prices).
💸Watch out for cross-AZ traffic costs. This can be an unpleasant surprise in architectures with large volume of traffic crossing AZ boundaries.
Deploy instances evenly across all available AZs, so that only a minimal fraction of your capacity is lost in case of an AZ outage.
If your architecture has single points of failure, put all of them into a single AZ. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it minimizes the likelihood of any one SPOF to go down on an outage of a single AZ.


EBS vs instance storage: For a number of years, EBSs had a poorer track record for availability than instance storage. For systems where individual instances can be killed and restarted easily, instance storage with sufficient redundancy could give higher availability overall. EBS has improved, and modern instance types (since 2015) are now EBS-only, so this approach, while helpful at one time, may be increasingly archaic.
Be sure to use and understand CLBs/ALBs appropriately. Many outages are due to not using load balancers, or misunderstanding or misconfiguring them.

High Availability Gotchas and Limitations

🔸AZ naming differs from one customer account to the next. Your “us-west-1a” is not the same as another customer’s “us-west-1a” — the letters are assigned to physical AZs randomly per account. This can also be a gotcha if you have multiple AWS accounts.
🔸💸Cross-AZ traffic is not free. At large scale, the costs add up to a significant amount of money. If possible, optimize your traffic to stay within the same AZ as much as possible.

Billing and Cost Management
Billing and Cost Visibility

AWS offers a free tier of service, that allows very limited usage of resources at no cost. For example, a micro instance and small amount of storage is available for no charge. Many services are only eligible for the free tier for the first twelve months that an account exists, but other services offer a free usage tier indefinitely. (If you have an old account but starting fresh, sign up for a new one to qualify for the free tier.) AWS Activate extends this to tens of thousands of dollars of free credits to startups in certain funds or accelerators.
You can set billing alerts to be notified of unexpected costs, such as costs exceeding the free tier. You can set these in a granular way.
AWS offers Cost Explorer, a tool to get better visibility into costs.
Unfortunately, the AWS console and billing tools are rarely enough to give good visibility into costs. For large accounts, the AWS billing console can time out or be too slow to use.
Tools:

🔹Enable billing reports and install an open source tool to help manage or monitor AWS resource utilization. Teevity Ice (originally written by Netflix) is probably the first one you should try. Check out docker-ice for a Dockerized version that eases installation.
🔸One challenge with Ice is that it doesn’t cover amortized cost of reserved instances.
Other tools include Security Monkey and Cloud Custodian.
Use AWS Simple Monthly Calculator to get an estimate of usage charges for AWS services based on certain information you provide. Monthly charges will be based on your actual usage of AWS services, and may vary from the estimates the Calculator has provided.


Third-party services: Several companies offer services designed to help you gain insights into expenses or lower your AWS bill, such as OpsClarity, Cloudability, CloudHealth Technologies, and ParkMyCloud. Some of these charge a percentage of your bill, which may be expensive. See the market landscape.
AWS’s Trusted Advisor is another service that can help with cost concerns.
Don’t be shy about asking your account manager for guidance in reducing your bill. It’s their job to keep you happily using AWS.
Tagging for cost visibility: As the infrastructure grows, a key part of managing costs is understanding where they lie. It’s strongly advisable to tag resources, and as complexity grows, group them effectively. If you set up billing allocation appropriately, you can then get visibility into expenses according to organization, product, individual engineer, or any other way that is helpful.
If you need to do custom analysis of raw billing data or want to feed it to a third party cost analysis service, enable the detailed billing report feature.
Multiple Amazon accounts can be linked for billing purposes using the Consolidated Billing feature. Large enterprises may need complex billing structures depending on ownership and approval processes.
Multiple Amazon accounts can be managed centrally using AWS Organizations.

AWS Data Transfer Costs

For deployments that involve significant network traffic, a large fraction of AWS expenses are around data transfer. Furthermore, costs of data transfer, within AZs, within regions, between regions, and into and out of AWS and the internet vary significantly depending on deployment choices.
Some of the most common gotchas:

🔸AZ-to-AZ traffic: Note EC2 traffic between AZs is effectively the same as between regions. For example, deploying a Cassandra cluster across AZs is helpful for high availability, but can hurt on network costs.
🔸Using public IPs when not necessary: If you use an Elastic IP or public IP address of an EC2 instance, you will incur network costs, even if it is accessed locally within the AZ.


This figure gives an overview:


EC2 Cost Management

With EC2, there is a trade-off between engineering effort (more analysis, more tools, more complex architectures) and spend rate on AWS. If your EC2 costs are small, many of the efforts here are not worth the engineering time required to make them work. But once you know your costs will be growing in excess of an engineer’s salary, serious investment is often worthwhile.
Larger instances aren’t necessarily priced higher in the spot market – therefore, you should look at the available options and determine which instances will be most cost effective for your jobs. See Bid Advisor.
🔹Spot instances:

EC2 Spot instances are a way to get EC2 resources at significant discount — often many times cheaper than standard on-demand prices — if you’re willing to accept the possibility that they be terminated with little to no warning.
Use Spot instances for potentially very significant discounts whenever you can use resources that may be restarted and don’t maintain long-term state.
The huge savings that you can get with Spot come at the cost of a significant increase in complexity when provisioning and reasoning about the availability of compute capacity.
Amazon maintains Spot prices at a market-driven fluctuating level, based on their inventory of unused capacity. Prices are typically low but can spike very high. See the price history to get a sense for this.
You set a bid price high to indicate how high you’re willing to pay, but you only pay the going rate, not the bid rate. If the market rate exceeds the bid, your instance may be terminated.
Prices are per instance type and per availability zone. The same instance type may have wildly different price in different zones at the same time. Different instance types can have very different prices, even for similarly powered instance types in the same zone.
Compare prices across instance types for better deals.
Use Spot instances whenever possible. Setting a high bid price will assure your machines stay up the vast majority of the time, at a fraction of the price of normal instances.
Get notified up to two minutes before price-triggered shutdown by polling your Spot instances’ metadata.
Make sure your usage profile works well for Spot before investing heavily in tools to manage a particular configuration.


Spot fleet:

You can realize even bigger cost reductions at the same time as improvements to fleet stability relative to regular Spot usage by using Spot fleet to bid on instances across instance types, availability zones, and (through multiple Spot Fleet Requests) regions.
Spot fleet targets maintaining a specified (and weighted-by-instance-type) total capacity across a cluster of servers. If the Spot price of one instance type and availability zone combination rises above the weighted bid, it will rotate running instances out and bring up new ones of another type and location up in order to maintain the target capacity without going over target cluster cost.


Spot usage best practices:

Application profiling:

Profile your application to figure out its runtime characteristics. That would help give an understanding of the minimum cpu, memory, disk required. Having this information is critical before you try to optimize spot costs.
Once you know the minimum application requirements, instead of resorting to fixed instance types, you can bid across a variety of instance types (that gives you higher chances of getting a spot instance to run your application).E.g., If you know that 4 cpu cores are enough for your job, you can choose any instance type that is equal or above 4 cores and that has the least Spot price based on history. This helps you bid for instances with greater discount (less demand at that point).


Spot price monitoring and intelligence:

Spot Instance prices fluctuate depending on instance types, time of day, region and availability zone. The AWS CLI tools and API allow you to describe Spot price metadata given time, instance type, and region/AZ.
Based on history of Spot instance prices, you could potentially build a myriad of algorithms that would help you to pick an instance type in a way that optimizes cost, maximizes availability, or offers predictable performance.
You can also track the number of times an instance of certain type got taken away (out bid) and plot that in graphite to improve your algorithm based on time of day.


Spot machine resource utilization:

For running spiky workloads (spark, map reduce jobs) that are schedule based and where failure is non critical, Spot instances become the perfect candidates.
The time it takes to satisfy a Spot instance could vary between 2-10 mins depending on the type of instance and availability of machines in that AZ.
If you are running an infrastructure with hundreds of jobs of spiky nature, it is advisable to start pooling instances to optimize for cost, performance and most importantly time to acquire an instance.
Pooling implies creating and maintaining Spot instances so that they do not get terminated after use. This promotes re-use of Spot instances across jobs. This of course comes with the overhead of lifecycle management.
Pooling has its own set of metrics that can be tracked to optimize resource utilization, efficiency and cost.
Typical pooling implementations give anywhere between 45-60% cost optimizations and 40% reduction in spot instance creation time.
An excellent example of Pooling implementation described by Netflix (part1, part2)




Spot management gotchas

🔸Lifetime: There is no guarantee for the lifetime of a Spot instance. It is purely based on bidding. If anyone outbids your price, the instance is taken away. Spot is not suitable for time sensitive jobs that have strong SLA. Instances will fail based on demand for Spot at that time. AWS provides a two-minute warning before Amazon EC2 must terminate your Spot instance.
🔹API return data: - The Spot price API returns Spot prices of varying granularity depending on the time range specified in the api call.E.g If the last 10 min worth of history is requested, the data is more fine grained. If the last 2 day worth of history is requested, the data is more coarser. Do not assume you will get all the data points. There will be skipped intervals.
❗Lifecycle management: Do not attempt any fancy Spot management unless absolutely necessary. If your entire usage is only a few machines and your cost is acceptable and your failure rate is lower, do not attempt to optimize. The pain for building/maintaining it is not worth just a few hundred dollar savings.


Reserved Instances: allow you to get significant discounts on EC2 compute hours in return for a commitment to pay for instance hours of a specific instance type in a specific AWS region and availability zone for a pre-established time frame (1 or 3 years). Further discounts can be realized through “partial” or “all upfront” payment options.

Consider using Reserved Instances when you can predict your longer-term compute needs and need a stronger guarantee of compute availability and continuity than the (typically cheaper) Spot market can provide. However be aware that if your architecture changes your computing needs may change as well so long term contracts can seem attractive but may turn out to be cumbersome.
There are two types of Reserved Instances - Standard and Convertible. If you purchase excess Standard Reserved Instances, you may offer to “sell back” unused Reserved Instances via the Reserved Instance Marketplace, this allows you to potentially recoup the cost of unused EC2 compute instance hours by selling them to other AWS customers.
Instance reservations are not tied to specific EC2 instances - they are applied at the billing level to eligible compute hours as they are consumed across all of the instances in an account.
📜There have been scattered reports of Convertible RI purchases needing to be exercised in a block-- namely, if you buy five convertible RIs in one purchase, you can't convert just two of them. Reach out to your account manager for clarification if this may impact you.


If you have multiple AWS accounts and have configured them to roll charges up to one account using the “Consolidated Billing” feature, you can expect unused Reserved Instance hours from one account to be applied to matching (region, availability zone, instance type) compute hours from another account.
If you have multiple AWS accounts that are linked with Consolidated Billing, plan on using reservations, and want unused reservation capacity to be able to apply to compute hours from other accounts, you’ll need to create your instances in the availability zone with the same name across accounts. Keep in mind that when you have done this, your instances may not end up in the same physical data center across accounts - Amazon shuffles availability zones names across accounts in order to equalize resource utilization.
Make use of dynamic Auto Scaling, where possible, in order to better match your cluster size (and cost) to the current resource requirements of your service.
If you use RHEL instances and happen to have existing RHEL on-premise Red Hat subscriptions, then you can leverage Red Hat's Cloud Access program to migrate a portion of your on-premise subscriptions to AWS, and thereby saving on AWS charges for RHEL subscriptions. You can either use your own self-created RHEL AMI's or Red Hat provided Gold Images that will be added to your private AMI's once you sign up for Red Hat Cloud Access.

slick
the last carousel you'll ever need
Demo
http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick
CDN
To start working with Slick right away, there's a couple of CDN choices availabile
to serve the files as close, and fast as possible to your users:

https://cdnjs.com/libraries/slick-carousel
https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/jquery.slick

Example using jsDelivr
Just add a link to the css file in your <head>:
<!-- Add the slick-theme.css if you want default styling -->
<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kenwheeler/slick@1.9.0/slick/slick.css""/>
<!-- Add the slick-theme.css if you want default styling -->
<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kenwheeler/slick@1.9.0/slick/slick-theme.css""/>
Then, before your closing <body> tag add:
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kenwheeler/slick@1.9.0/slick/slick.min.js""></script>
Package Managers
# Bower
bower install --save slick-carousel

# NPM
npm install slick-carousel

Data Attribute Settings
In slick 1.5 you can now add settings using the data-slick attribute. You still need to call $(element).slick() to initialize slick on the element.
Example:
<div data-slick='{""slidesToShow"": 4, ""slidesToScroll"": 4}'>
  <div><h3>1</h3></div>
  <div><h3>2</h3></div>
  <div><h3>3</h3></div>
  <div><h3>4</h3></div>
  <div><h3>5</h3></div>
  <div><h3>6</h3></div>
</div>

  // normal options...
  infinite: false,

  // the magic
  responsive: [{

      breakpoint: 1024,
      settings: {
        slidesToShow: 3,
        infinite: true
      }

    }, {

      breakpoint: 600,
      settings: {
        slidesToShow: 2,
        dots: true
      }

    }, {

      breakpoint: 300,
      settings: ""unslick"" // destroys slick

    }]
});
Events
In slick 1.4, callback methods were deprecated and replaced with events. Use them before the initialization of slick as shown below:
// On swipe event
$('.your-element').on('swipe', function(event, slick, direction){
  console.log(direction);
  // left
});

// On edge hit
$('.your-element').on('edge', function(event, slick, direction){
  console.log('edge was hit')
});

// On before slide change
$('.your-element').on('beforeChange', function(event, slick, currentSlide, nextSlide){
  console.log(nextSlide);
});

Prometheus






Visit prometheus.io for the full documentation,
examples and guides.
Prometheus, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project, is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics
from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,
displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed
to be true.
Prometheus' main distinguishing features as compared to other monitoring systems are:

a multi-dimensional data model (timeseries defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)
a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
no dependency on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
timeseries collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
pushing timeseries is supported via an intermediary gateway
targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support
support for hierarchical and horizontal federation

Architecture overview

Install
There are various ways of installing Prometheus.
Precompiled binaries
Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the
download section
on prometheus.io. Using the latest production release binary
is the recommended way of installing Prometheus.
See the Installing
chapter in the documentation for all the details.
Debian packages are available.
Docker images
Docker images are available on Quay.io or Docker Hub.
You can launch a Prometheus container for trying it out with
$ docker run --name prometheus -d -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 prom/prometheus

Prometheus will now be reachable at http://localhost:9090/.
Building from source
To build Prometheus from the source code yourself you need to have a working
Go environment with version 1.12 or greater installed.
You can directly use the go tool to download and install the prometheus
and promtool binaries into your GOPATH:
$ go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus/cmd/...
$ prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml

You can also clone the repository yourself and build using make:
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
$ git clone https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus.git
$ cd prometheus
$ make build
$ ./prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml

The Makefile provides several targets:

build: build the prometheus and promtool binaries
test: run the tests
test-short: run the short tests
format: format the source code
vet: check the source code for common errors
assets: rebuild the static assets
docker: build a docker container for the current HEAD

More information

The source code is periodically indexed: Prometheus Core.
You will find a Travis CI configuration in .travis.yml.
See the Community page for how to reach the Prometheus developers and users on various communication channels.

Butter Knife

Field and method binding for Android views which uses annotation processing to generate boilerplate
code for you.

Eliminate findViewById calls by using @BindView on fields.
Group multiple views in a list or array. Operate on all of them at once with actions,
setters, or properties.
Eliminate anonymous inner-classes for listeners by annotating methods with @OnClick and others.
Eliminate resource lookups by using resource annotations on fields.

class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
  @BindView(R.id.user) EditText username;
  @BindView(R.id.pass) EditText password;

  @BindString(R.string.login_error) String loginErrorMessage;

  @OnClick(R.id.submit) void submit() {
    // TODO call server...
  }

  @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.simple_activity);
    ButterKnife.bind(this);
    // TODO Use fields...
  }
}
For documentation and additional information see the website.
Remember: A butter knife is like a dagger only infinitely less sharp.
Download
android {
  ...
  // Butterknife requires Java 8.
  compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.jakewharton:butterknife:10.1.0'
  annotationProcessor 'com.jakewharton:butterknife-compiler:10.1.0'
}
If you are using Kotlin, replace annotationProcessor with kapt.
Snapshots of the development version are available in Sonatype's snapshots repository.
Library projects
To use Butter Knife in a library, add the plugin to your buildscript:
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    google()
   }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.jakewharton:butterknife-gradle-plugin:10.1.0'
  }
}
and then apply it in your module:
apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
apply plugin: 'com.jakewharton.butterknife'
Now make sure you use R2 instead of R inside all Butter Knife annotations.
class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
  @BindView(R2.id.user) EditText username;
  @BindView(R2.id.pass) EditText password;
...
}

Face Recognition
You can also read a translated version of this file in Chinese 简体中文版.
Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with
the world's simplest face recognition library.
Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the
Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
This also provides a simple face_recognition command line tool that lets
you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!



Features
Find faces in pictures
Find all the faces that appear in a picture:

import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""your_file.jpg"")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
Find and manipulate facial features in pictures
Get the locations and outlines of each person's eyes, nose, mouth and chin.

import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""your_file.jpg"")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)
Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff. But you can also use it for really stupid stuff
like applying digital make-up (think 'Meitu'):

Identify faces in pictures
Recognize who appears in each photo.

import face_recognition
known_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""biden.jpg"")
unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""unknown.jpg"")

biden_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_image)[0]
unknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image)[0]

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([biden_encoding], unknown_encoding)
You can even use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition:

See this example for the code.
Online Demos
User-contributed shared Jupyter notebook demo (not officially supported): 
Installation
Requirements

Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7
macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported, but might work)

Installation Options:
Installing on Mac or Linux
First, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:

How to install dlib from source on macOS or Ubuntu

Then, install this module from pypi using pip3 (or pip2 for Python 2):
pip3 install face_recognition
Alternatively, you can try this library with Docker, see this section.
If you are having trouble with installation, you can also try out a
pre-configured VM.
Installing on Raspberry Pi 2+

Raspberry Pi 2+ installation instructions

Installing on Windows
While Windows isn't officially supported, helpful users have posted instructions on how to install this library:

@masoudr's Windows 10 installation guide (dlib + face_recognition)

Installing a pre-configured Virtual Machine image

Download the pre-configured VM image (for VMware Player or VirtualBox).

Usage
Command-Line Interface
When you install face_recognition, you get two simple command-line
programs:

face_recognition - Recognize faces in a photograph or folder full for
photographs.
face_detection - Find faces in a photograph or folder full for photographs.

face_recognition command line tool
The face_recognition command lets you recognize faces in a photograph or
folder full  for photographs.
First, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person you
already know. There should be one image file for each person with the
files named according to who is in the picture:

Next, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:

Then in you simply run the command face_recognition, passing in
the folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with unknown
people and it tells you who is in each image:
$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person
There's one line in the output for each face. The data is comma-separated
with the filename and the name of the person found.
An unknown_person is a face in the image that didn't match anyone in
your folder of known people.
face_detection command line tool
The face_detection command lets you find the location (pixel coordinatates)
of any faces in an image.
Just run the command face_detection, passing in a folder of images
to check (or a single image):
$ face_detection  ./folder_with_pictures/

examples/image1.jpg,65,215,169,112
examples/image2.jpg,62,394,211,244
examples/image2.jpg,95,941,244,792
It prints one line for each face that was detected. The coordinates
reported are the top, right, bottom and left coordinates of the face (in pixels).
Adjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity
If you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be that
the people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value
is needed to make face comparisons more strict.
You can do that with the --tolerance parameter. The default tolerance
value is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:
$ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person
If you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in order
to adjust the tolerance setting, you can use --show-distance true:
$ face_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/

/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785
/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,None
More Examples
If you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but don't
care about file names, you could do this:
$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2

Barack Obama
unknown_person
Speeding up Face Recognition
Face recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with
multiple CPU cores. For example, if your system has 4 CPU cores, you can
process about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by using
all your CPU cores in parallel.
If you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a --cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use> parameter:
$ face_recognition --cpus 4 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/
You can also pass in --cpus -1 to use all CPU cores in your system.
Python Module
You can import the face_recognition module and then easily manipulate
faces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!
API Docs: https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io.
Automatically find all the faces in an image
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""my_picture.jpg"")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
See this example
to try it out.
You can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face detection model.
Note: GPU acceleration (via NVidia's CUDA library) is required for good
performance with this model. You'll also want to enable CUDA support
when compliling dlib.
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""my_picture.jpg"")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image, model=""cnn"")

# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!
See this example
to try it out.
If you have a lot of images and a GPU, you can also
find faces in batches.
Automatically locate the facial features of a person in an image
import face_recognition

image = face_recognition.load_image_file(""my_picture.jpg"")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

# face_landmarks_list is now an array with the locations of each facial feature in each face.
# face_landmarks_list[0]['left_eye'] would be the location and outline of the first person's left eye.
See this example
to try it out.
Recognize faces in images and identify who they are
import face_recognition

picture_of_me = face_recognition.load_image_file(""me.jpg"")
my_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(picture_of_me)[0]

# my_face_encoding now contains a universal 'encoding' of my facial features that can be compared to any other picture of a face!

unknown_picture = face_recognition.load_image_file(""unknown.jpg"")
unknown_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_picture)[0]

# Now we can see the two face encodings are of the same person with `compare_faces`!

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([my_face_encoding], unknown_face_encoding)

if results[0] == True:
    print(""It's a picture of me!"")
else:
    print(""It's not a picture of me!"")
See this example
to try it out.

Caveats

The face recognition model is trained on adults and does not work very well on children. It tends to mix
up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.
Accuracy may vary between ethnic groups. Please see this wiki page for more details.

Deployment to Cloud Hosts (Heroku, AWS, etc)
Since face_recognition depends on dlib which is written in C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app
using it to a cloud hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.
To make things easier, there's an example Dockerfile in this repo that shows how to run an app built with
face_recognition in a Docker container. With that, you should be able to deploy
to any service that supports Docker images.
You can try the Docker image locally by running: docker-compose up --build
Linux users with a GPU (drivers >= 384.81) and Nvidia-Docker installed can run the example on the GPU: Open the docker-compose.yml file and uncomment the dockerfile: Dockerfile.gpu and runtime: nvidia lines.
Having problems?
If you run into problems, please read the Common Errors section of the wiki before filing a github issue.
Thanks

Many, many thanks to Davis King (@nulhom)
for creating dlib and for providing the trained facial feature detection and face encoding models
used in this library. For more information on the ResNet that powers the face encodings, check out
his blog post.
Thanks to everyone who works on all the awesome Python data science libraries like numpy, scipy, scikit-image,
pillow, etc, etc that makes this kind of stuff so easy and fun in Python.
Thanks to Cookiecutter and the
audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage project template
for making Python project packaging way more tolerable.

Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress 💅



  





Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!
styled-components is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native – meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the documentation about React Native for more information.
Supported by Front End Center. Thank you for making this possible!
v5
Principal development of v5 has begun! Follow along on the canary branch and check out the current list of roadmap items.
We will be publishing alpha versions to styled-components@canary on NPM as we get closer to a beta release.
Please keep in mind that all development of styled-components is driven by volunteer effort, so things will take as long as they take. We appreciate your enthusiasm and interest as new technologies and patterns emerge.

// Create a <Title> react component that renders an <h1> which is
// centered, palevioletred and sized at 1.5em
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;

// Create a <Wrapper> react component that renders a <section> with
// some padding and a papayawhip background
const Wrapper = styled.section`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
`;

// Use them like any other React component – except they're styled!
<Wrapper>
  <Title>Hello World, this is my first styled component!</Title>
</Wrapper>
This is what you'll see in your browser:





Babel Macro
If you're using tooling that has babel-plugin-macros set up, you can switch to the styled-components/macro import path instead to gain the effects of the babel plugin without further setup.
import styled from 'styled-components/macro';

// A static className will be generated for Title (important for SSR)
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`;
If you wish to provide configuration options to the babel plugin similar to how you would in a .babelrc, see this guide. The config name is ""styledComponents"".
Built with styled-components
A lot of hard work goes into community libraries, projects, and guides. A lot of them make it easier to get started or help you with your next project! There’s also a whole lot of interesting apps and sites that people have built using styled-components.
Make sure to head over to awesome-styled-components to see them all! And please contribute and add your own work to the list so others can find it.

Modernizr




Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the user’s browser.

Website
Documentation

Modernizr tests which native CSS3 and HTML5 features are available in the current UA and makes the results available to you in two ways: as properties on a global Modernizr object, and as classes on the <html> element. This information allows you to progressively enhance your pages with a granular level of control over the experience.
This project adheres to the Open Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to honor this code.
New Asynchronous Event Listeners
Often times people want to know when an asynchronous test is done so they can allow their application to react to it.
In the past, you've had to rely on watching properties or <html> classes. Only events on asynchronous tests are
supported. Synchronous tests should be handled synchronously to improve speed and to maintain consistency.
The new API looks like this:
// Listen to a test, give it a callback
Modernizr.on('testname', function( result ) {
  if (result) {
    console.log('The test passed!');
  }
  else {
    console.log('The test failed!');
  }
});
We guarantee that we'll only invoke your function once (per time that you call on). We are currently not exposing
a method for exposing the trigger functionality. Instead, if you'd like to have control over async tests, use the
src/addTest feature, and any test that you set will automatically expose and trigger the on functionality.
Getting Started

Clone or download the repository
Install project dependencies with npm install

Test suite
Run the test suite
Building Modernizr v3
To generate everything in 'config-all.json':
npm install
./bin/modernizr -c lib/config-all.json
//outputs to ./modernizr.js
To run tests on the console (in phantom):
grunt test
To run tests in the browser:
grunt browserResults
then visit http://localhost:9090/test/unit.html for unit test results
or visit http://localhost:9090/test/index.html to see which features that browser supports
To see the build tool:

checkout the modernizr.com code
install all your gems and bundles and jekyll
jekyll
serve ./_sites
visit /download
It should be just a big list of things you can build with no frills.

API Reference
Modernizr can be used programmatically via npm:
var modernizr = require(""modernizr"");
Building
A build method is exposed for generating custom Modernizr builds. Example:
var modernizr = require(""modernizr"");

modernizr.build({}, function (result) {
  console.log(result); // the build
});
The first parameter takes a JSON object of options and feature-detects to include. See lib/config-all.json for all available options.
The second parameter is a function invoked on task completion.

Select2



Select2 is a jQuery-based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching,
remote data sets, and pagination of results.
To get started, checkout examples and documentation at
https://select2.org/
Use cases

Enhancing native selects with search.
Enhancing native selects with a better multi-select interface.
Loading data from JavaScript: easily load items via AJAX and have them
searchable.
Nesting optgroups: native selects only support one level of nesting. Select2
does not have this restriction.
Tagging: ability to add new items on the fly.
Working with large, remote datasets: ability to partially load a dataset based
on the search term.
Paging of large datasets: easy support for loading more pages when the results
are scrolled to the end.
Templating: support for custom rendering of results and selections.

Browser compatibility

IE 8+
Chrome 8+
Firefox 10+
Safari 3+
Opera 10.6+

Select2 is automatically tested on the following browsers.

Usage
You can source Select2 directly from a CDN like JSDliver or
CDNJS, download it from this GitHub repo, or use one of
the integrations below.
Integrations
Third party developers have created plugins for platforms which allow Select2 to be integrated more natively and quickly. For many platforms, additional plugins are not required because Select2 acts as a standard <select> box.

Request for assistance
Things are piling up and I have hard time keeping up. To remedy this
it would be great if we could form a core team of developers to cooperate
with the future development mermaid.
As part of this team you would get write access to the repository and would
represent the project when answering questions and issues.
Together we could continue the work with things like:

adding more typers of diagrams like mindmaps, ert digrams etc
improving existing diagrams

Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to get involved.

Go Ethereum
Official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol.




Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch.
Binary archives are published at https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.
Building the source
For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the
Installation Instructions
on the wiki.
Building geth requires both a Go (version 1.10 or later) and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run
make geth

or, to build the full suite of utilities:
make all

Executables
The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the cmd directory.



Command
Description




geth
Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. geth --help and the CLI Wiki page for command line options.


abigen
Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain Ethereum contract ABIs with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our Native DApps wiki page for details.


bootnode
Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.


evm
Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. evm --code 60ff60ff --debug).


gethrpctest
Developer utility tool to support our ethereum/rpc-test test suite which validates baseline conformity to the Ethereum JSON RPC specs. Please see the test suite's readme for details.


rlpdump
Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP (Recursive Length Prefix) dumps (data encoding used by the Ethereum protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user-friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263).


swarm
Swarm daemon and tools. This is the entry point for the Swarm network. swarm --help for command line options and subcommands. See Swarm README for more information.


puppeth
a CLI wizard that aids in creating a new Ethereum network.



Running geth
Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
CLI Wiki page), but we've
enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your
own Geth instance.
Full node on the main Ethereum network
By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum network:
create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this particular use-case
the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can fast-sync quickly to the current
state of the network. To do so:
$ geth console

This command will:

Start geth in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the --syncmode flag), causing it to
download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history of the Ethereum network,
which is very CPU intensive.
Start up Geth's built-in interactive JavaScript console,
(via the trailing console subcommand) through which you can invoke all official web3 methods
as well as Geth's own management APIs.
This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running Geth instance
with geth attach.

A Full node on the Ethereum test network
Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Ethereum contracts, you
almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until you get the hang of the
entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main network, you want to join the test
network with your node, which is fully equivalent to the main network, but with play-Ether only.
$ geth --testnet console

The console subcommand has the exact same meaning as above and they are equally useful on the
testnet too. Please see above for their explanations if you've skipped here.
Specifying the --testnet flag, however, will reconfigure your Geth instance a bit:

Instead of using the default data directory (~/.ethereum on Linux for example), Geth will nest
itself one level deeper into a testnet subfolder (~/.ethereum/testnet on Linux). Note, on OSX
and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node requires the use of a custom
endpoint since geth attach will try to attach to a production node endpoint by default. E.g.
geth attach <datadir>/testnet/geth.ipc. Windows users are not affected by this.
Instead of connecting the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the test network,
which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis states.

Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from crossing
over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always use separate accounts
for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move accounts, Geth will by default correctly
separate the two networks and will not make any accounts available between them.
Full node on the Rinkeby test network
The above test network is a cross-client one based on the ethash proof-of-work consensus algorithm. As such, it has certain extra overhead and is more susceptible to reorganization attacks due to the network's low difficulty/security. Go Ethereum also supports connecting to a proof-of-authority based test network called Rinkeby (operated by members of the community). This network is lighter, more secure, but is only supported by go-ethereum.
$ geth --rinkeby console

Configuration
As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the geth binary, you can also pass a configuration file via:
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the dumpconfig subcommand to export your existing configuration:
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig

Note: This works only with geth v1.6.0 and above.
Docker quick start
One of the quickest ways to get Ethereum up and running on your machine is by using Docker:
docker run -d --name ethereum-node -v /Users/alice/ethereum:/root \
           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
           ethereum/client-go

This will start geth in fast-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB just as the above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an alpine tag available for a slim version of the image.
Do not forget --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0, if you want to access RPC from other containers and/or hosts. By default, geth binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints is not accessible from the outside.
Programmatically interfacing Geth nodes
As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with Geth and the Ethereum
network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid this, Geth has built-in
support for a JSON-RPC based APIs (standard APIs and
Geth specific APIs). These can be
exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based platforms, and named pipes on Windows).
The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by Geth, whereas the HTTP
and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a subset of APIs due to security reasons.
These can be turned on/off and configured as you'd expect.
HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

--rpc Enable the HTTP-RPC server
--rpcaddr HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: ""localhost"")
--rpcport HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: 8545)
--rpcapi API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: ""eth,net,web3"")
--rpccorsdomain Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
--ws Enable the WS-RPC server
--wsaddr WS-RPC server listening interface (default: ""localhost"")
--wsport WS-RPC server listening port (default: 8546)
--wsapi API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: ""eth,net,web3"")
--wsorigins Origins from which to accept websockets requests
--ipcdisable Disable the IPC-RPC server
--ipcapi API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: ""admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3"")
--ipcpath Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to connect
via HTTP, WS or IPC to a Geth node configured with the above flags and you'll need to speak JSON-RPC
on all transports. You can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!
Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based transport before
doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs!
Further, all browser tabs can access locally running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to
subvert locally available APIs!
Operating a private network
Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for granted in
the official networks need to be manually set up.
Defining the private genesis state
First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be aware of
and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it genesis.json):
{
  ""config"": {
        ""chainId"": 0,
        ""homesteadBlock"": 0,
        ""eip155Block"": 0,
        ""eip158Block"": 0
    },
  ""alloc""      : {},
  ""coinbase""   : ""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"",
  ""difficulty"" : ""0x20000"",
  ""extraData""  : """",
  ""gasLimit""   : ""0x2fefd8"",
  ""nonce""      : ""0x0000000000000042"",
  ""mixhash""    : ""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"",
  ""parentHash"" : ""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"",
  ""timestamp""  : ""0x00""
}
The above fields should be fine for most purposes, although we'd recommend changing the nonce to
some random value so you prevent unknown remote nodes from being able to connect to you. If you'd
like to pre-fund some accounts for easier testing, you can populate the alloc field with account
configs:
""alloc"": {
  ""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001"": {""balance"": ""111111111""},
  ""0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002"": {""balance"": ""222222222""}
}
With the genesis state defined in the above JSON file, you'll need to initialize every Geth node
with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly set:
$ geth init path/to/genesis.json

Creating the rendezvous point
With all nodes that you want to run initialized to the desired genesis state, you'll need to start a
bootstrap node that others can use to find each other in your network and/or over the internet. The
clean way is to configure and run a dedicated bootnode:
$ bootnode --genkey=boot.key
$ bootnode --nodekey=boot.key

With the bootnode online, it will display an enode URL
that other nodes can use to connect to it and exchange peer information. Make sure to replace the
displayed IP address information (most probably [::]) with your externally accessible IP to get the
actual enode URL.
Note: You could also use a full-fledged Geth node as a bootnode, but it's the less recommended way.
Starting up your member nodes
With the bootnode operational and externally reachable (you can try telnet <ip> <port> to ensure
it's indeed reachable), start every subsequent Geth node pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery
via the --bootnodes flag. It will probably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your
private network separated, so do also specify a custom --datadir flag.
$ geth --datadir=path/to/custom/data/folder --bootnodes=<bootnode-enode-url-from-above>

Note: Since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks, you'll also
need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you.
Running a private miner
Mining on the public Ethereum network is a complex task as it's only feasible using GPUs, requiring
an OpenCL or CUDA enabled ethminer instance. For information on such a setup, please consult the
EtherMining subreddit and the Genoil miner
repository.
In a private network setting, however a single CPU miner instance is more than enough for practical
purposes as it can produce a stable stream of blocks at the correct intervals without needing heavy
resources (consider running on a single thread, no need for multiple ones either). To start a Geth
instance for mining, run it with all your usual flags, extended by:
$ geth <usual-flags> --mine --minerthreads=1 --etherbase=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Which will start mining blocks and transactions on a single CPU thread, crediting all proceedings to
the account specified by --etherbase. You can further tune the mining by changing the default gas
limit blocks converge to (--targetgaslimit) and the price transactions are accepted at (--gasprice).

The PHP Interpreter
PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to
web development. Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your
blog to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is distributed under the PHP
License v3.01.


Documentation
The PHP manual is available at php.net/docs.
Installation
Prebuilt packages and binaries
Prebuilt packages and binaries can be used to get up and running fast with PHP.
For Windows, the PHP binaries can be obtained from
windows.php.net. After extracting the archive the
*.exe files are ready to use.
For other systems, see the installation chapter.
Building PHP source code
For Windows, see Build your own PHP on Windows.
PHP uses autotools on Unix systems to configure the build:
./buildconf
./configure [options]

See ./configure -h for configuration options.
make [options]

See make -h for make options.
The -j option shall set the maximum number of jobs make can use for the
build:
make -j4

Shall run make with a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs: Generally the maximum
number of jobs should not exceed the number of cores available.
Testing PHP source code
PHP ships with an extensive test suite, the command make test is used after
successful compilation of the sources to run this test suite.
It is possible to run tests using multiple cores by setting -jN in
TEST_PHP_ARGS:
make TEST_PHP_ARGS=-j4 test

Shall run make test with a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs: Generally the maximum
number of jobs should not exceed the number of cores available.
The qa.php.net site provides more detailed info about
testing and quality assurance.
Installing PHP built from source
After a successful build (and test), PHP may be installed with:
make install

Depending on your permissions and prefix, make install may need super user
permissions.
PHP extensions
Extensions provide additional functionality on top of PHP. PHP consists of many
essential bundled extensions. Additional extensions can be found in the PHP
Extension Community Library - PECL.
Contributing
The PHP source code is located in the Git repository at
git.php.net. Contributions are most welcome by forking
the GitHub mirror repository and sending a
pull request.
Discussions are done on GitHub, but depending on the topic can also be relayed
to the official PHP developer mailing list internals@lists.php.net.
New features require an RFC and must be accepted by the developers. See
Request for comments - RFC and
Voting on PHP features for more information
on the process.
Bug fixes do not require an RFC but require a bug tracker ticket. Open a
ticket at bugs.php.net and reference the bug id using
#NNNNNN.
Fix #55371: get_magic_quotes_gpc() throws deprecation warning

After removing magic quotes, the get_magic_quotes_gpc function caused a
deprecated warning. get_magic_quotes_gpc can be used to detect the
magic_quotes behavior and therefore should not raise a warning at any time.
The patch removes this warning.

Pull requests are not merged directly on GitHub. All PRs will be pulled and
pushed through git.php.net. See
Git workflow for more details.
Guidelines for contributors

Status
frp is under development and you can try it with latest release version. Master branch for releasing stable version when dev branch for developing.
We may change any protocol and can't promise backward compatible. Please check the release log when upgrading.
Architecture

Example Usage
Firstly, download the latest programs from Release page according to your os and arch.
Put frps and frps.ini to your server with public IP.
Put frpc and frpc.ini to your server in LAN.
Access your computer in LAN by SSH

Modify frps.ini:

# frps.ini
[common]
bind_port = 7000

Start frps:

./frps -c ./frps.ini

Modify frpc.ini, server_addr is your frps's server IP:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[ssh]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 22
remote_port = 6000

Start frpc:

./frpc -c ./frpc.ini

Connect to server in LAN by ssh assuming that username is test:

ssh -oPort=6000 test@x.x.x.x
Visit your web service in LAN by custom domains
Sometimes we want to expose a local web service behind a NAT network to others for testing with your own domain name and unfortunately we can't resolve a domain name to a local ip.
However, we can expose a http or https service using frp.

Modify frps.ini, configure http port 8080:

# frps.ini
[common]
bind_port = 7000
vhost_http_port = 8080

Start frps:

./frps -c ./frps.ini

Modify frpc.ini and set remote frps server's IP as x.x.x.x. The local_port is the port of your web service:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[web]
type = http
local_port = 80
custom_domains = www.yourdomain.com

Start frpc:

./frpc -c ./frpc.ini


Resolve A record of www.yourdomain.com to IP x.x.x.x or CNAME record to your origin domain.


Now visit your local web service using url http://www.yourdomain.com:8080.


Forward DNS query request

Modify frps.ini:

# frps.ini
[common]
bind_port = 7000

Start frps:

./frps -c ./frps.ini

Modify frpc.ini, set remote frps's server IP as x.x.x.x, forward dns query request to google dns server 8.8.8.8:53:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[dns]
type = udp
local_ip = 8.8.8.8
local_port = 53
remote_port = 6000

Start frpc:

./frpc -c ./frpc.ini

Send dns query request by dig:

dig @x.x.x.x -p 6000 www.google.com
Forward unix domain socket
Using tcp port to connect unix domain socket like docker daemon.
Configure frps same as above.

Start frpc with configurations:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[unix_domain_socket]
type = tcp
remote_port = 6000
plugin = unix_domain_socket
plugin_unix_path = /var/run/docker.sock

Get docker version by curl command:

curl http://x.x.x.x:6000/version
Expose a simple http file server
A simple way to visit files in the LAN.
Configure frps same as above.

Start frpc with configurations:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[test_static_file]
type = tcp
remote_port = 6000
plugin = static_file
plugin_local_path = /tmp/file
plugin_strip_prefix = static
plugin_http_user = abc
plugin_http_passwd = abc

Visit http://x.x.x.x:6000/static/ by your browser, set correct user and password, so you can see files in /tmp/file.

Enable HTTPS for local HTTP service

Start frpc with configurations:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[test_htts2http]
type = https
custom_domains = test.yourdomain.com

plugin = https2http
plugin_local_addr = 127.0.0.1:80
plugin_crt_path = ./server.crt
plugin_key_path = ./server.key
plugin_host_header_rewrite = 127.0.0.1

Visit https://test.yourdomain.com.

Expose your service in security
For some services, if expose them to the public network directly will be a security risk.
stcp(secret tcp) helps you create a proxy avoiding any one can access it.
Configure frps same as above.

Start frpc, forward ssh port and remote_port is useless:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[secret_ssh]
type = stcp
sk = abcdefg
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 22

Start another frpc in which you want to connect this ssh server:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[secret_ssh_visitor]
type = stcp
role = visitor
server_name = secret_ssh
sk = abcdefg
bind_addr = 127.0.0.1
bind_port = 6000

Connect to server in LAN by ssh assuming that username is test:

ssh -oPort=6000 test@127.0.0.1
P2P Mode
xtcp is designed for transmitting a large amount of data directly between two client.
Now it can't penetrate all types of NAT devices. You can try stcp if xtcp doesn't work.

Configure a udp port for xtcp:

bind_udp_port = 7001

Start frpc, forward ssh port and remote_port is useless:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[p2p_ssh]
type = xtcp
sk = abcdefg
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 22

Start another frpc in which you want to connect this ssh server:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000

[p2p_ssh_visitor]
type = xtcp
role = visitor
server_name = p2p_ssh
sk = abcdefg
bind_addr = 127.0.0.1
bind_port = 6000

Connect to server in LAN by ssh assuming that username is test:

ssh -oPort=6000 test@127.0.0.1
Features
Configuration File
You can find features which this document not metioned from full example configuration files.
frps full configuration file
frpc full configuration file
Configuration file template
Configuration file tempalte can be rendered using os environments. Template uses Go's standard format.
# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = {{ .Envs.FRP_SERVER_ADDR }}
server_port = 7000

[ssh]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 22
remote_port = {{ .Envs.FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT }}
Start frpc program:
export FRP_SERVER_ADDR=""x.x.x.x""
export FRP_SSH_REMOTE_PORT=""6000""
./frpc -c ./frpc.ini

frpc will auto render configuration file template using os environments.
All environments has prefix .Envs.
Dashboard
Check frp's status and proxies's statistics information by Dashboard.
Configure a port for dashboard to enable this feature:
[common]
dashboard_port = 7500
# dashboard's username and password are both optional，if not set, default is admin.
dashboard_user = admin
dashboard_pwd = admin
Then visit http://[server_addr]:7500 to see dashboard, default username and password are both admin.

Admin UI
Admin UI help you check and manage frpc's configure.
Configure a address for admin UI to enable this feature:
[common]
admin_addr = 127.0.0.1
admin_port = 7400
admin_user = admin
admin_pwd = admin
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:7400 to see admin UI, default username and password are both admin.
Authentication
token in frps.ini and frpc.ini should be same.
Encryption and Compression
Defalut value is false, you could decide if the proxy will use encryption or compression:
# frpc.ini
[ssh]
type = tcp
local_port = 22
remote_port = 6000
use_encryption = true
use_compression = true
TLS
frp support TLS protocol between frpc and frps since v0.25.0.
Config tls_enable = true in common section to frpc.ini to enable this feature.
For port multiplexing, frp send a first byte 0x17 to dial a TLS connection.
Hot-Reload frpc configuration
First you need to set admin port in frpc's configure file to let it provide HTTP API for more features.
# frpc.ini
[common]
admin_addr = 127.0.0.1
admin_port = 7400
Then run command frpc reload -c ./frpc.ini and wait for about 10 seconds to let frpc create or update or delete proxies.
Note that parameters in [common] section won't be modified except 'start' now.
Get proxy status from client
Use frpc status -c ./frpc.ini to get status of all proxies. You need to set admin port in frpc's configure file.
Port White List
allow_ports in frps.ini is used for preventing abuse of ports:
# frps.ini
[common]
allow_ports = 2000-3000,3001,3003,4000-50000
allow_ports consists of a specific port or a range of ports divided by ,.
Port Reuse
Now vhost_http_port and vhost_https_port in frps can use same port with bind_port. frps will detect connection's protocol and handle it correspondingly.
We would like to try to allow multiple proxies bind a same remote port with different protocols in the future.
TCP Stream Multiplexing
frp support tcp stream multiplexing since v0.10.0 like HTTP2 Multiplexing. All user requests to same frpc can use only one tcp connection.
You can disable this feature by modify frps.ini and frpc.ini:
# frps.ini and frpc.ini, must be same
[common]

Support KCP Protocol
KCP is a fast and reliable protocol that can achieve the transmission effect of a reduction of the average latency by 30% to 40% and reduction of the maximum delay by a factor of three, at the cost of 10% to 20% more bandwidth wasted than TCP.
Using kcp in frp:

Enable kcp protocol in frps:

# frps.ini
[common]
bind_port = 7000
# kcp needs to bind a udp port, it can be same with 'bind_port'
kcp_bind_port = 7000

Configure the protocol used in frpc to connect frps:

# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
# specify the 'kcp_bind_port' in frps
server_port = 7000
protocol = kcp
Connection Pool
By default, frps send message to frpc for create a new connection to backward service when getting an user request.If a proxy's connection pool is enabled, there will be a specified number of connections pre-established.
This feature is fit for a large number of short connections.

Configure the limit of pool count each proxy can use in frps.ini:

# frps.ini
[common]
max_pool_count = 5

Enable and specify the number of connection pool:

# frpc.ini
[common]
pool_count = 1
Load balancing
Load balancing is supported by group.
This feature is available only for type tcp now.
# frpc.ini
[test1]
type = tcp
local_port = 8080
remote_port = 80
group = web
group_key = 123

[test2]
type = tcp
local_port = 8081
remote_port = 80
group = web
group_key = 123
group_key is used for authentication.
Proxies in same group will accept connections from port 80 randomly.
Health Check
Health check feature can help you achieve high availability with load balancing.
Add health_check_type = {type} to enable health check.
type can be tcp or http.
Type tcp will dial the service port and type http will send a http rquest to service and require a 200 response.
Type tcp configuration:
# frpc.ini
[test1]
type = tcp
local_port = 22
remote_port = 6000
# enable tcp health check
health_check_type = tcp
# dial timeout seconds
health_check_timeout_s = 3
# if continuous failed in 3 times, the proxy will be removed from frps
health_check_max_failed = 3
# every 10 seconds will do a health check
health_check_interval_s = 10
Type http configuration:
# frpc.ini
[web]
type = http
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 80
custom_domains = test.yourdomain.com
# enable http health check
health_check_type = http
# frpc will send a GET http request '/status' to local http service
# http service is alive when it return 2xx http response code
health_check_url = /status
health_check_interval_s = 10
health_check_max_failed = 3
health_check_timeout_s = 3
Rewriting the Host Header
When forwarding to a local port, frp does not modify the tunneled HTTP requests at all, they are copied to your server byte-for-byte as they are received. Some application servers use the Host header for determining which development site to display. For this reason, frp can rewrite your requests with a modified host header. Use the host_header_rewrite switch to rewrite incoming HTTP requests.
# frpc.ini
[web]
type = http
local_port = 80
custom_domains = test.yourdomain.com
host_header_rewrite = dev.yourdomain.com
The Host request header will be rewritten to Host: dev.yourdomain.com before it reach your local http server.
Set Headers In HTTP Request
You can set headers for proxy which type is http.
# frpc.ini
[web]
type = http
local_port = 80
custom_domains = test.yourdomain.com
host_header_rewrite = dev.yourdomain.com
header_X-From-Where = frp
Note that params which have prefix header_ will be added to http request headers.
In this example, it will set header X-From-Where: frp to http request.
Get Real IP
HTTP X-Forwarded-For
Features for http proxy only.
You can get user's real IP from HTTP request header X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP.
Proxy Protocol
frp support Proxy Protocol to send user's real IP to local service. It support all types without UDP.
Here is an example for https service:
# frpc.ini
[web]
type = https
local_port = 443
custom_domains = test.yourdomain.com

# now v1 and v2 is supported
proxy_protocol_version = v2
You can enable Proxy Protocol support in nginx to parse user's real IP to http header X-Real-IP.
Then you can get it from HTTP request header in your local service.
Password protecting your web service
Anyone who can guess your tunnel URL can access your local web server unless you protect it with a password.
This enforces HTTP Basic Auth on all requests with the username and password you specify in frpc's configure file.
It can only be enabled when proxy type is http.
# frpc.ini
[web]
type = http
local_port = 80
custom_domains = test.yourdomain.com
http_user = abc
http_pwd = abc
Visit http://test.yourdomain.com and now you need to input username and password.
Custom subdomain names
It is convenient to use subdomain configure for http、https type when many people use one frps server together.
# frps.ini
subdomain_host = frps.com
Resolve *.frps.com to the frps server's IP.
# frpc.ini
[web]
type = http
local_port = 80
subdomain = test
Now you can visit your web service by host test.frps.com.
Note that if subdomain_host is not empty, custom_domains should not be the subdomain of subdomain_host.
URL routing
frp support forward http requests to different backward web services by url routing.
locations specify the prefix of URL used for routing. frps first searches for the most specific prefix location given by literal strings regardless of the listed order.
# frpc.ini
[web01]
type = http
local_port = 80
custom_domains = web.yourdomain.com
locations = /

[web02]
type = http
local_port = 81
custom_domains = web.yourdomain.com
locations = /news,/about
Http requests with url prefix /news and /about will be forwarded to web02 and others to web01.
Connect frps by HTTP PROXY
frpc can connect frps using HTTP PROXY if you set os environment HTTP_PROXY or configure http_proxy param in frpc.ini file.
It only works when protocol is tcp.
# frpc.ini
[common]
server_addr = x.x.x.x
server_port = 7000
http_proxy = http://user:pwd@192.168.1.128:8080
Range ports mapping
Proxy name has prefix range: will support mapping range ports.
# frpc.ini
[range:test_tcp]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 6000-6006,6007
remote_port = 6000-6006,6007
frpc will generate 8 proxies like test_tcp_0, test_tcp_1 ... test_tcp_7.
Plugin
frpc only forward request to local tcp or udp port by default.
Plugin is used for providing rich features. There are built-in plugins such as unix_domain_socket, http_proxy, socks5, static_file and you can see example usage.
Specify which plugin to use by plugin parameter. Configuration parameters of plugin should be started with plugin_. local_ip and local_port is useless for plugin.
Using plugin http_proxy:
# frpc.ini
[http_proxy]
type = tcp
remote_port = 6000
plugin = http_proxy
plugin_http_user = abc
plugin_http_passwd = abc
plugin_http_user and plugin_http_passwd are configuration parameters used in http_proxy plugin.
Development Plan

Log http request information in frps.

Introduction

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book
Clean Code,
adapted for JavaScript. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
readable, reusable, and refactorable software in JavaScript.
Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be
universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are
ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of
Clean Code.
Our craft of software engineering is just a bit over 50 years old, and we are
still learning a lot. When software architecture is as old as architecture
itself, maybe then we will have harder rules to follow. For now, let these
guidelines serve as a touchstone by which to assess the quality of the
JavaScript code that you and your team produce.
One more thing: knowing these won't immediately make you a better software
developer, and working with them for many years doesn't mean you won't make
mistakes. Every piece of code starts as a first draft, like wet clay getting
shaped into its final form. Finally, we chisel away the imperfections when
we review it with our peers. Don't beat yourself up for first drafts that need
improvement. Beat up the code instead!
Variables
Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names
Bad:
const yyyymmdstr = moment().format(""YYYY/MM/DD"");
Good:
const currentDate = moment().format(""YYYY/MM/DD"");
⬆ back to top
Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable
Bad:
getUserInfo();
getClientData();
getCustomerRecord();
Good:
getUser();
⬆ back to top
Use searchable names
We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we
do write is readable and searchable. By not naming variables that end up
being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable. Tools like
buddy.js and
ESLint
can help identify unnamed constants.
Bad:
// What the heck is 86400000 for?
setTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);
Good:
// Declare them as capitalized named constants.
const MILLISECONDS_IN_A_DAY = 86400000;

setTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_IN_A_DAY);
⬆ back to top
Use explanatory variables
Bad:
const address = ""One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014"";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
saveCityZipCode(
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[1],
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[2]
);
Good:
const address = ""One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014"";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
const [, city, zipCode] = address.match(cityZipCodeRegex) || [];
saveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);

Avoid Mental Mapping
Explicit is better than implicit.
Bad:
const locations = [""Austin"", ""New York"", ""San Francisco""];
locations.forEach(l => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  // Wait, what is `l` for again?
  dispatch(l);
});
Good:
const locations = [""Austin"", ""New York"", ""San Francisco""];
locations.forEach(location => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  // ...
  // ...
  // ...
  dispatch(location);
});
⬆ back to top
Don't add unneeded context
If your class/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your
variable name.
Bad:
const Car = {
  carMake: ""Honda"",
  carModel: ""Accord"",
  carColor: ""Blue""
};

function paintCar(car) {
  car.carColor = ""Red"";
}
Good:
const Car = {
  make: ""Honda"",
  model: ""Accord"",
  color: ""Blue""
};

function paintCar(car) {
  car.color = ""Red"";
}

Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals
Default arguments are often cleaner than short circuiting. Be aware that if you
use them, your function will only provide default values for undefined
arguments. Other ""falsy"" values such as '', """", false, null, 0, and
NaN, will not be replaced by a default value.
Bad:
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  const breweryName = name || ""Hipster Brew Co."";
  // ...
}
Good:
function createMicrobrewery(name = ""Hipster Brew Co."") {
  // ...
}
⬆ back to top
Functions
Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)
Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it
makes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a
combinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with
each separate argument.
One or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible.
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have
more than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases
where it's not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an
argument.
Since JavaScript allows you to make objects on the fly, without a lot of class
boilerplate, you can use an object if you are finding yourself needing a
lot of arguments.
To make it obvious what properties the function expects, you can use the ES2015/ES6
destructuring syntax. This has a few advantages:

When someone looks at the function signature, it's immediately clear what
properties are being used.
Destructuring also clones the specified primitive values of the argument
object passed into the function. This can help prevent side effects. Note:
objects and arrays that are destructured from the argument object are NOT
cloned.
Linters can warn you about unused properties, which would be impossible
without destructuring.

Bad:
function createMenu(title, body, buttonText, cancellable) {
  // ...
}
Good:
function createMenu({ title, body, buttonText, cancellable }) {
  // ...
}

createMenu({
  title: ""Foo"",
  body: ""Bar"",
  buttonText: ""Baz"",
  cancellable: true
});
⬆ back to top
Functions should do one thing
This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, they can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.
Bad:
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
Good:
function emailActiveClients(clients) {
  clients.filter(isActiveClient).forEach(email);
}

function isActiveClient(client) {
  const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
  return clientRecord.isActive();
}
⬆ back to top
Function names should say what they do
Bad:
function addToDate(date, month) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();

// It's hard to tell from the function name what is added
addToDate(date, 1);
Good:
function addMonthToDate(month, date) {
  // ...
}

const date = new Date();
addMonthToDate(1, date);
⬆ back to top
Functions should only be one level of abstraction
When you have more than one level of abstraction your function is usually
doing too much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier
testing.
Bad:
function parseBetterJSAlternative(code) {
  const REGEXES = [
    // ...
  ];

  const statements = code.split("" "");
  const tokens = [];
  REGEXES.forEach(REGEX => {
    statements.forEach(statement => {
      // ...
    });
  });

  const ast = [];
  tokens.forEach(token => {
    // lex...
  });

  ast.forEach(node => {
    // parse...
  });
}
Good:
function parseBetterJSAlternative(code) {
  const tokens = tokenize(code);
  const syntaxTree = parse(tokens);
  syntaxTree.forEach(node => {
    // parse...
  });
}

function tokenize(code) {
  const REGEXES = [
    // ...
  ];

  const statements = code.split("" "");
  const tokens = [];
  REGEXES.forEach(REGEX => {
    statements.forEach(statement => {
      tokens.push(/* ... */);
    });
  });

  return tokens;
}

function parse(tokens) {
  const syntaxTree = [];
  tokens.forEach(token => {
    syntaxTree.push(/* ... */);
  });

  return syntaxTree;
}

Remove duplicate code
Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because it
means that there's more than one place to alter something if you need to change
some logic.
Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your
tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that
you keep this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with
tomatoes in them. If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!
Oftentimes you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly
different things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you
to have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing
duplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of
different things with just one function/module/class.
Getting the abstraction right is critical, that's why you should follow the
SOLID principles laid out in the Classes section. Bad abstractions can be
worse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make
a good abstraction, do it! Don't repeat yourself, otherwise you'll find yourself
updating multiple places anytime you want to change one thing.
Bad:
function showDeveloperList(developers) {
  developers.forEach(developer => {
    const expectedSalary = developer.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = developer.getExperience();
    const githubLink = developer.getGithubLink();
    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience,
      githubLink
    };

    render(data);
  });
}

function showManagerList(managers) {
  managers.forEach(manager => {
    const expectedSalary = manager.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = manager.getExperience();
    const portfolio = manager.getMBAProjects();
    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience,
      portfolio
    };

    render(data);
  });
}
Good:
function showEmployeeList(employees) {
  employees.forEach(employee => {
    const expectedSalary = employee.calculateExpectedSalary();
    const experience = employee.getExperience();

    const data = {
      expectedSalary,
      experience
    };

    switch (employee.type) {
      case ""manager"":
        data.portfolio = employee.getMBAProjects();
        break;
      case ""developer"":
        data.githubLink = employee.getGithubLink();
        break;
    }

    render(data);
  });
}

Set default objects with Object.assign
Bad:
const menuConfig = {
  title: null,
  body: ""Bar"",
  buttonText: null,
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  config.title = config.title || ""Foo"";
  config.body = config.body || ""Bar"";
  config.buttonText = config.buttonText || ""Baz"";
  config.cancellable =
    config.cancellable !== undefined ? config.cancellable : true;
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
Good:
const menuConfig = {
  title: ""Order"",
  // User did not include 'body' key
  buttonText: ""Send"",
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  config = Object.assign(
    {
      title: ""Foo"",
      body: ""Bar"",
      buttonText: ""Baz"",
      cancellable: true
    },
    config
  );

  // config now equals: {title: ""Order"", body: ""Bar"", buttonText: ""Send"", cancellable: true}
  // ...
}

createMenu(menuConfig);

Don't use flags as function parameters
Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions should do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths based on a boolean.
Bad:
function createFile(name, temp) {
  if (temp) {
    fs.create(`./temp/${name}`);
  } else {
    fs.create(name);
  }
}
Good:
function createFile(name) {
  fs.create(name);
}

function createTempFile(name) {
  createFile(`./temp/${name}`);
}

Avoid Side Effects (part 1)
A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in
and return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file,
modifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a
stranger.
Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous
example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to
centralize where you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes
that write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.
The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects
without any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,
and not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will
be happier than the vast majority of other programmers.
Bad:
// Global variable referenced by following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it could break it.
let name = ""Ryan McDermott"";

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {
  name = name.split("" "");
}

splitIntoFirstAndLastName();

console.log(name); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
Good:
function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name) {
  return name.split("" "");
}

const name = ""Ryan McDermott"";
const newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name);

console.log(name); // 'Ryan McDermott';
console.log(newName); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
⬆ back to top
Avoid Side Effects (part 2)
In JavaScript, primitives are passed by value and objects/arrays are passed by
reference. In the case of objects and arrays, if your function makes a change
in a shopping cart array, for example, by adding an item to purchase,
then any other function that uses that cart array will be affected by this
addition. That may be great, however it can be bad too. Let's imagine a bad
situation:
The user clicks the ""Purchase"", button which calls a purchase function that
spawns a network request and sends the cart array to the server. Because
of a bad network connection, the purchase function has to keep retrying the
request. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks ""Add to Cart""
button on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins?
If that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function
will send the accidentally added item because it has a reference to a shopping
cart array that the addItemToCart function modified by adding an unwanted
item.
A great solution would be for the addItemToCart to always clone the cart,
edit it, and return the clone. This ensures that no other functions that are
holding onto a reference of the shopping cart will be affected by any changes.
Two caveats to mention to this approach:


There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,
but when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases
are pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!


Cloning big objects can be very expensive in terms of performance. Luckily,
this isn't a big issue in practice because there are
great libraries that allow
this kind of programming approach to be fast and not as memory intensive as
it would be for you to manually clone objects and arrays.


Bad:
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  cart.push({ item, date: Date.now() });
};
Good:
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  return [...cart, { item, date: Date.now() }];
};

Don't write to global functions
Polluting globals is a bad practice in JavaScript because you could clash with another
library and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an
exception in production. Let's think about an example: what if you wanted to
extend JavaScript's native Array method to have a diff method that could
show the difference between two arrays? You could write your new function
to the Array.prototype, but it could clash with another library that tried
to do the same thing. What if that other library was just using diff to find
the difference between the first and last elements of an array? This is why it
would be much better to just use ES2015/ES6 classes and simply extend the Array global.
Bad:
Array.prototype.diff = function diff(comparisonArray) {
  const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);
  return this.filter(elem => !hash.has(elem));
};
Good:
class SuperArray extends Array {
  diff(comparisonArray) {
    const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);
    return this.filter(elem => !hash.has(elem));
  }
}

Favor functional programming over imperative programming
JavaScript isn't a functional language in the way that Haskell is, but it has
a functional flavor to it. Functional languages can be cleaner and easier to test.
Favor this style of programming when you can.

Avoid conditionals
This seems like an impossible task. Upon first hearing this, most people say,
""how am I supposed to do anything without an if statement?"" The answer is that
you can use polymorphism to achieve the same task in many cases. The second
question is usually, ""well that's great but why would I want to do that?"" The
answer is a previous clean code concept we learned: a function should only do
one thing. When you have classes and functions that have if statements, you
are telling your user that your function does more than one thing. Remember,
just do one thing.

Avoid type-checking (part 1)
JavaScript is untyped, which means your functions can take any type of argument.
Sometimes you are bitten by this freedom and it becomes tempting to do
type-checking in your functions. There are many ways to avoid having to do this.
The first thing to consider is consistent APIs.
Bad:
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  if (vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {
    vehicle.pedal(this.currentLocation, new Location(""texas""));
  } else if (vehicle instanceof Car) {
    vehicle.drive(this.currentLocation, new Location(""texas""));
  }
}
Good:
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  vehicle.move(this.currentLocation, new Location(""texas""));
}
⬆ back to top
Avoid type-checking (part 2)
If you are working with basic primitive values like strings and integers,
and you can't use polymorphism but you still feel the need to type-check,
you should consider using TypeScript. It is an excellent alternative to normal
JavaScript, as it provides you with static typing on top of standard JavaScript
syntax. The problem with manually type-checking normal JavaScript is that
doing it well requires so much extra verbiage that the faux ""type-safety"" you get
doesn't make up for the lost readability. Keep your JavaScript clean, write
good tests, and have good code reviews. Otherwise, do all of that but with
TypeScript (which, like I said, is a great alternative!).
Bad:
function combine(val1, val2) {
  if (
    (typeof val1 === ""number"" && typeof val2 === ""number"") ||
    (typeof val1 === ""string"" && typeof val2 === ""string"")
  ) {
    return val1 + val2;
  }

  throw new Error(""Must be of type String or Number"");
}
Good:
function combine(val1, val2) {
  return val1 + val2;
}

Don't over-optimize
Modern browsers do a lot of optimization under-the-hood at runtime. A lot of
times, if you are optimizing then you are just wasting your time. There are good
resources
for seeing where optimization is lacking. Target those in the meantime, until
they are fixed if they can be.
Bad:
// On old browsers, each iteration with uncached `list.length` would be costly
// because of `list.length` recomputation. In modern browsers, this is optimized.
for (let i = 0, len = list.length; i < len; i++) {

Good:
for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {

Remove dead code
Dead code is just as bad as duplicate code. There's no reason to keep it in
your codebase. If it's not being called, get rid of it! It will still be safe
in your version history if you still need it.
Bad:
function oldRequestModule(url) {
  // ...
}

function newRequestModule(url) {

const req = newRequestModule;
inventoryTracker(""apples"", req, ""www.inventory-awesome.io"");

Objects and Data Structures
Use getters and setters
Using getters and setters to access data on objects could be better than simply
looking for a property on an object. ""Why?"" you might ask. Well, here's an
unorganized list of reasons why:

When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have
to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
Makes adding validation simple when doing a set.
Encapsulates the internal representation.
Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.
You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a
server.

Bad:
function makeBankAccount() {
  // ...

  return {
    balance: 0
    // ...
  };
}

const account = makeBankAccount();
account.balance = 100;
Good:
function makeBankAccount() {
  // this one is private
  let balance = 0;

  // a ""getter"", made public via the returned object below
  function getBalance() {
    return balance;
  }

  // a ""setter"", made public via the returned object below
  function setBalance(amount) {
    // ... validate before updating the balance
    balance = amount;
  }

  return {
    // ...
    getBalance,
    setBalance
  };
}

const account = makeBankAccount();
account.setBalance(100);

Make objects have private members
This can be accomplished through closures (for ES5 and below).
Bad:
const Employee = function(name) {
  this.name = name;
};

Employee.prototype.getName = function getName() {
  return this.name;
};

const employee = new Employee(""John Doe"");
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: John Doe
delete employee.name;
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: undefined
Good:
function makeEmployee(name) {
  return {
    getName() {
      return name;
    }
  };
}

const employee = makeEmployee(""John Doe"");
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: John Doe
delete employee.name;
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: John Doe

Classes
Prefer ES2015/ES6 classes over ES5 plain functions
It's very difficult to get readable class inheritance, construction, and method
definitions for classical ES5 classes. If you need inheritance (and be aware
that you might not), then prefer ES2015/ES6 classes. However, prefer small functions over
classes until you find yourself needing larger and more complex objects.
Bad:
const Animal = function(age) {
  if (!(this instanceof Animal)) {
    throw new Error(""Instantiate Animal with `new`"");
  }

  this.age = age;
};

Animal.prototype.move = function move() {};

const Mammal = function(age, furColor) {
  if (!(this instanceof Mammal)) {
    throw new Error(""Instantiate Mammal with `new`"");
  }

  Animal.call(this, age);
  this.furColor = furColor;
};

Mammal.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Mammal.prototype.constructor = Mammal;
Mammal.prototype.liveBirth = function liveBirth() {};

const Human = function(age, furColor, languageSpoken) {
  if (!(this instanceof Human)) {
    throw new Error(""Instantiate Human with `new`"");
  }

  Mammal.call(this, age, furColor);
  this.languageSpoken = languageSpoken;
};

Human.prototype = Object.create(Mammal.prototype);
Human.prototype.constructor = Human;
Human.prototype.speak = function speak() {};
Good:
class Animal {
  constructor(age) {
    this.age = age;

  move() {
    /* ... */
  }
}

class Mammal extends Animal {
  constructor(age, furColor) {

    super(age, furColor);
    this.languageSpoken = languageSpoken;
  }

  speak() {
    /* ... */

Use method chaining
This pattern is very useful in JavaScript and you see it in many libraries such
as jQuery and Lodash. It allows your code to be expressive, and less verbose.
For that reason, I say, use method chaining and take a look at how clean your code
will be. In your class functions, simply return this at the end of every function,
and you can chain further class methods onto it.
Bad:
class Car {
  constructor(make, model, color) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
  }

  setMake(make) {
    this.make = make;
  }

  setModel(model) {
    this.model = model;
  }

  setColor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  save() {
    console.log(this.make, this.model, this.color);
  }
}

const car = new Car(""Ford"", ""F-150"", ""red"");
car.setColor(""pink"");
car.save();
Good:
class Car {
  constructor(make, model, color) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
  }

  setMake(make) {
    this.make = make;
    // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
    return this;
  }

  setModel(model) {
    this.model = model;
    // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
    return this;
  }

  setColor(color) {
    this.color = color;

Prefer composition over inheritance
As stated famously in Design Patterns by the Gang of Four,
you should prefer composition over inheritance where you can. There are lots of
good reasons to use inheritance and lots of good reasons to use composition.
The main point for this maxim is that if your mind instinctively goes for
inheritance, try to think if composition could model your problem better. In some
cases it can.
You might be wondering then, ""when should I use inheritance?"" It
depends on your problem at hand, but this is a decent list of when inheritance
makes more sense than composition:

Your inheritance represents an ""is-a"" relationship and not a ""has-a""
relationship (Human->Animal vs. User->UserDetails).
You can reuse code from the base classes (Humans can move like all animals).
You want to make global changes to derived classes by changing a base class.
(Change the caloric expenditure of all animals when they move).

Bad:
class Employee {
  constructor(name, email) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }

  // ...
}

// Bad because Employees ""have"" tax data. EmployeeTaxData is not a type of Employee
class EmployeeTaxData extends Employee {
  constructor(ssn, salary) {
    super();
    this.ssn = ssn;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  // ...
}
Good:
class EmployeeTaxData {
  constructor(ssn, salary) {
    this.ssn = ssn;
    this.salary = salary;

SOLID
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
As stated in Clean Code, ""There should never be more than one reason for a class
to change"". It's tempting to jam-pack a class with a lot of functionality, like
when you can only take one suitcase on your flight. The issue with this is
that your class won't be conceptually cohesive and it will give it many reasons
to change. Minimizing the amount of times you need to change a class is important.
It's important because if too much functionality is in one class and you modify
a piece of it, it can be difficult to understand how that will affect other
dependent modules in your codebase.
Bad:
class UserSettings {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user;
  }

  changeSettings(settings) {
    if (this.verifyCredentials()) {
      // ...
    }
  }

  verifyCredentials() {
    // ...
  }
}
Good:
class UserAuth {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user;

Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
As stated by Bertrand Meyer, ""software entities (classes, modules, functions,
etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."" What does that
mean though? This principle basically states that you should allow users to
add new functionalities without changing existing code.
Bad:

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
This is a scary term for a very simple concept. It's formally defined as ""If S
is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S
(i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any
of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed,
etc.)."" That's an even scarier definition.
The best explanation for this is if you have a parent class and a child class,
then the base class and child class can be used interchangeably without getting
incorrect results. This might still be confusing, so let's take a look at the
classic Square-Rectangle example. Mathematically, a square is a rectangle, but
if you model it using the ""is-a"" relationship via inheritance, you quickly
get into trouble.
Bad:
class Rectangle {
  constructor() {
    this.width = 0;
    this.height = 0;
  }

  setColor(color) {
    // ...
  }

  render(area) {
    // ...

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.height;

class Square extends Rectangle {
  setWidth(width) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = width;
  }

  setHeight(height) {
    this.width = height;
    this.height = height;
  }
}

function renderLargeRectangles(rectangles) {
  rectangles.forEach(rectangle => {
    rectangle.setWidth(4);
    rectangle.setHeight(5);
    const area = rectangle.getArea(); // BAD: Returns 25 for Square. Should be 20.
    rectangle.render(area);
  });
}

const rectangles = [new Rectangle(), new Rectangle(), new Square()];
renderLargeRectangles(rectangles);
Good:
class Shape {
  setColor(color) {
    // ...

  render(area) {
    // ...

}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  constructor(width, height) {
    super();
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.height;

class Square extends Shape {

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
JavaScript doesn't have interfaces so this principle doesn't apply as strictly
as others. However, it's important and relevant even with JavaScript's lack of
type system.
ISP states that ""Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that
they do not use."" Interfaces are implicit contracts in JavaScript because of
duck typing.
A good example to look at that demonstrates this principle in JavaScript is for
classes that require large settings objects. Not requiring clients to setup
huge amounts of options is beneficial, because most of the time they won't need
all of the settings. Making them optional helps prevent having a
""fat interface"".
Bad:
class DOMTraverser {
  constructor(settings) {
    this.settings = settings;
    this.setup();
  }

  setup() {
    this.rootNode = this.settings.rootNode;
    this.animationModule.setup();
  }

  traverse() {
    // ...
  }
}

const $ = new DOMTraverser({
  rootNode: document.getElementsByTagName(""body""),
  animationModule() {} // Most of the time, we won't need to animate when traversing.
  // ...
});
Good:
class DOMTraverser {
  constructor(settings) {
    this.settings = settings;
    this.options = settings.options;

  rootNode: document.getElementsByTagName(""body""),
  options: {
    animationModule() {}

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
This principle states two essential things:

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on
abstractions.

This can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with AngularJS,
you've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency
Injection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level
modules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up.
It can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces
the coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because
it makes your code hard to refactor.
As stated previously, JavaScript doesn't have interfaces so the abstractions
that are depended upon are implicit contracts. That is to say, the methods
and properties that an object/class exposes to another object/class. In the
example below, the implicit contract is that any Request module for an
InventoryTracker will have a requestItems method.
Bad:
class InventoryRequester {
  constructor() {
    this.REQ_METHODS = [""HTTP""];
  }

  requestItem(item) {
    // ...
  }
}

class InventoryTracker {
  constructor(items) {
    this.items = items;

    // BAD: We have created a dependency on a specific request implementation.
    // We should just have requestItems depend on a request method: `request`
    this.requester = new InventoryRequester();
  }

  requestItems() {
    this.items.forEach(item => {
      this.requester.requestItem(item);
    });
  }
}

const inventoryTracker = new InventoryTracker([""apples"", ""bananas""]);
inventoryTracker.requestItems();
Good:
class InventoryTracker {
  constructor(items, requester) {
    this.items = items;
    this.requester = requester;
  }

  requestItems() {
    this.items.forEach(item => {
      this.requester.requestItem(item);
    });
  }
}

class InventoryRequesterV1 {
  constructor() {
    this.REQ_METHODS = [""HTTP""];
  }

  requestItem(item) {
    // ...
  }
}

class InventoryRequesterV2 {
  constructor() {
    this.REQ_METHODS = [""WS""];
  }

  requestItem(item) {
    // ...
  }
}

// By constructing our dependencies externally and injecting them, we can easily
// substitute our request module for a fancy new one that uses WebSockets.
const inventoryTracker = new InventoryTracker(
  [""apples"", ""bananas""],
  new InventoryRequesterV2()
);

Testing
Testing is more important than shipping. If you have no tests or an
inadequate amount, then every time you ship code you won't be sure that you
didn't break anything. Deciding on what constitutes an adequate amount is up
to your team, but having 100% coverage (all statements and branches) is how
you achieve very high confidence and developer peace of mind. This means that
in addition to having a great testing framework, you also need to use a
good coverage tool.
There's no excuse to not write tests. There are plenty of good JS test frameworks, so find one that your team prefers.
When you find one that works for your team, then aim to always write tests
for every new feature/module you introduce. If your preferred method is
Test Driven Development (TDD), that is great, but the main point is to just
make sure you are reaching your coverage goals before launching any feature,
or refactoring an existing one.

Async/Await are even cleaner than Promises
Promises are a very clean alternative to callbacks, but ES2017/ES8 brings async and await
which offer an even cleaner solution. All you need is a function that is prefixed
in an async keyword, and then you can write your logic imperatively without
a then chain of functions. Use this if you can take advantage of ES2017/ES8 features
today!

Error Handling
Thrown errors are a good thing! They mean the runtime has successfully
identified when something in your program has gone wrong and it's letting
you know by stopping function execution on the current stack, killing the
process (in Node), and notifying you in the console with a stack trace.
Don't ignore caught errors
Doing nothing with a caught error doesn't give you the ability to ever fix
or react to said error. Logging the error to the console (console.log)
isn't much better as often times it can get lost in a sea of things printed
to the console. If you wrap any bit of code in a try/catch it means you
think an error may occur there and therefore you should have a plan,
or create a code path, for when it occurs.
Bad:
try {
  functionThatMightThrow();
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
Good:
try {
  functionThatMightThrow();
} catch (error) {
  // One option (more noisy than console.log):
  console.error(error);
  // Another option:
  notifyUserOfError(error);
  // Another option:
  reportErrorToService(error);
  // OR do all three!
}
Don't ignore rejected promises
For the same reason you shouldn't ignore caught errors
from try/catch.
Bad:
getdata()
  .then(data => {
    functionThatMightThrow(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  });
Good:
getdata()
  .then(data => {
    functionThatMightThrow(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // One option (more noisy than console.log):
    console.error(error);
    // Another option:
    notifyUserOfError(error);
    // Another option:
    reportErrorToService(error);
    // OR do all three!
  });

Formatting
Formatting is subjective. Like many rules herein, there is no hard and fast
rule that you must follow. The main point is DO NOT ARGUE over formatting.
There are tons of tools to automate this.
Use one! It's a waste of time and money for engineers to argue over formatting.
For things that don't fall under the purview of automatic formatting
(indentation, tabs vs. spaces, double vs. single quotes, etc.) look here
for some guidance.
Use consistent capitalization
JavaScript is untyped, so capitalization tells you a lot about your variables,
functions, etc. These rules are subjective, so your team can choose whatever
they want. The point is, no matter what you all choose, just be consistent.
Bad:
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
const daysInMonth = 30;

const songs = [""Back In Black"", ""Stairway to Heaven"", ""Hey Jude""];
const Artists = [""ACDC"", ""Led Zeppelin"", ""The Beatles""];

function eraseDatabase() {}
function restore_database() {}

class animal {}
class Alpaca {}
Good:
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
const DAYS_IN_MONTH = 30;

const SONGS = [""Back In Black"", ""Stairway to Heaven"", ""Hey Jude""];
const ARTISTS = [""ACDC"", ""Led Zeppelin"", ""The Beatles""];

function eraseDatabase() {}
function restoreDatabase() {}

class Animal {}
class Alpaca {}
⬆ back to top
Function callers and callees should be close
If a function calls another, keep those functions vertically close in the source
file. Ideally, keep the caller right above the callee. We tend to read code from
top-to-bottom, like a newspaper. Because of this, make your code read that way.
Bad:
class PerformanceReview {
  constructor(employee) {
    this.employee = employee;
  }

  lookupPeers() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, ""peers"");
  }

  lookupManager() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, ""manager"");
  }

  getPeerReviews() {
    const peers = this.lookupPeers();
    // ...
  }

  perfReview() {
    this.getPeerReviews();
    this.getManagerReview();
    this.getSelfReview();
  }

  getManagerReview() {
    const manager = this.lookupManager();
  }

  getSelfReview() {
    // ...
  }
}

const review = new PerformanceReview(employee);
review.perfReview();
Good:
class PerformanceReview {
  constructor(employee) {
    this.employee = employee;
  }

  perfReview() {
    this.getPeerReviews();
    this.getManagerReview();
    this.getSelfReview();
  }

  getPeerReviews() {
    const peers = this.lookupPeers();
    // ...
  }

  lookupPeers() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, ""peers"");
  }

  getManagerReview() {
    const manager = this.lookupManager();
  }

  lookupManager() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, ""manager"");
  }

  getSelfReview() {
    // ...
  }
}

const review = new PerformanceReview(employee);
review.perfReview();

Comments
Only comment things that have business logic complexity.
Comments are an apology, not a requirement. Good code mostly documents itself.
Bad:
function hashIt(data) {
  // The hash
  let hash = 0;

  // Length of string
  const length = data.length;

  // Loop through every character in data
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    // Get character code.
    const char = data.charCodeAt(i);
    // Make the hash
    hash = (hash << 5) - hash + char;
    // Convert to 32-bit integer
    hash &= hash;
  }
}
Good:
function hashIt(data) {
  let hash = 0;
  const length = data.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    const char = data.charCodeAt(i);
    hash = (hash << 5) - hash + char;

    // Convert to 32-bit integer
    hash &= hash;
  }
}
⬆ back to top
Don't leave commented out code in your codebase
Version control exists for a reason. Leave old code in your history.
Bad:
doStuff();
// doOtherStuff();
// doSomeMoreStuff();
// doSoMuchStuff();
Good:
doStuff();
⬆ back to top
Don't have journal comments
Remember, use version control! There's no need for dead code, commented code,
and especially journal comments. Use git log to get history!
Bad:
/**
 * 2016-12-20: Removed monads, didn't understand them (RM)
 * 2016-10-01: Improved using special monads (JP)
 * 2016-02-03: Removed type-checking (LI)
 * 2015-03-14: Added combine with type-checking (JR)
 */
function combine(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
Good:
function combine(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
⬆ back to top
Avoid positional markers
They usually just add noise. Let the functions and variable names along with the
proper indentation and formatting give the visual structure to your code.
Bad:
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Scope Model Instantiation
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
$scope.model = {
  menu: ""foo"",
  nav: ""bar""
};

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Action setup
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
const actions = function() {
  // ...

  menu: ""foo"",
  nav: ""bar""

程序员找工作黑名单
🐌我也只是围观群众，背后的真相大家自己判断，我只是单纯的收藏一些链接，不喜勿喷，欢迎大家关注我微博和提 issues 来参与维护这个名单
最近的事情 让我意识到 有些同行也是劣迹斑斑，需要记录一下 以后大家招聘注意
写在前面
谢谢 issues 提醒
首先，每一个程序猿，每一个公司都有黑点，但是如果把黑点放大了，黑名单就没存在的意义了。就拿这几个例子来吧


世纪佳缘认为白帽子，是违法的

虽然这件事是我怒开 repo 的起因，但是他没有拖欠员工工资或不付工资



与创始人说的股份，那是个人争取的事

也没拖欠工资或不付工资
只是记住以后记得留个心眼，和合伙人不是只写代码就可以的



华为清理 34 岁以上员工，也是按照合同裁员，给赔偿

大公司更新换代，裁员没有任何问题，不裁员的公司早晚倒闭
华为也没有拖欠工资
只是我个人觉得，因为这件事，不想去华为工作 仅此而已，害怕到了34就被干掉



有些事情，应该被记住

神舟深圳总部

神舟电脑深圳总部是否常在校招之后出现大规模离职？为什么？如何评价？



选公司

建议大家在选择公司的时候摸摸底子 http://tianyancha.com ，发现有问题直接问负责人省的吃哑巴亏。
知乎合集：有哪些公司给你留下「还好没去这家公司」的印象？

当技术合伙人建议

选自冯大辉的微博 只写代码和当合伙人，还是有很大差别的，我觉得上面的建议很中肯

最后


最后说一下心得，竟然还有希望 GitHub 处理这个 repo，原因是想维护github这份纯净，还把 GitHub 被墙和我挂钩，我真是醉了，就像一群待宰的羔羊，心想着只要老实一点，宰的就是别人不是我一样


我只是记录一下自己看到过的事件，我自己下次换工作的时候防止踩坑，仅此而已


我也没有那么愤世嫉俗，比如我以后换工作，还是会考虑百度阿里的，但是会避免上面出现的坑，比如百度无人车我就不去啦，阿里的其他很多部门还是很棒的，希望到时候不会因为这个名单把我 pass 吧😂



求star，支持我继续把这个名单维护下去,谢谢支持

PixiJS — The HTML5 Creation Engine



The aim of this project is to provide a fast lightweight 2D library that works
across all devices. The PixiJS renderer allows everyone to enjoy the power of
hardware acceleration without prior knowledge of WebGL. Also, it's fast. Really fast.
If you want to keep up to date with the latest PixiJS news then feel free to follow us on twitter
(@doormat23, @rolnaaba, @bigtimebuddy, @ivanpopelyshev)
and we will keep you posted! You can also check back on our site
as any breakthroughs will be posted up there too!
Your support helps us make PixiJS even better. Make your pledge on Patreon and we'll love you forever!
What to Use PixiJS for and When to Use It
PixiJS is a rendering library that will allow you to create rich, interactive graphics, cross platform applications, and games without having to dive into the WebGL API or deal with browser and device compatibility.
PixiJS has full WebGL support and seamlessly falls back to HTML5's canvas if needed. As a framework, PixiJS is a fantastic tool for authoring interactive content, especially with the move away from Adobe Flash in recent years. Use it for your graphics rich, interactive websites, applications, and HTML5 games.  Out of the box cross-platform compatibility and graceful degradation mean you have less work to do and have more fun doing it! If you want to create polished and refined experiences relatively quickly, without delving into dense, low level code, all while avoiding the headaches of browser inconsistencies, then sprinkle your next project with some PixiJS magic!
Boost your development and feel free to use your imagination!

Setup
It's easy to get started with PixiJS! Simply download a prebuilt build!
Alternatively, PixiJS can be installed with npm or simply using a content delivery network (CDN) URL to embed PixiJS directly on your HTML page.
Note: After v4.5.0, support for the Bower package manager has been dropped. Please see the release notes for more information.
NPM Install
npm install pixi.js
There is no default export. The correct way to import PixiJS is:
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js'
CDN Install (via cdnjs)
<script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pixi.js/4.5.1/pixi.min.js""></script>
Note: 4.5.1 can be replaced by any released version.

Canvas renderer (Fastest in town!)
Full scene graph
Super easy to use API (similar to the flash display list API)
Support for texture atlases
Asset loader / sprite sheet loader
Auto-detect which renderer should be used
Full Mouse and Multi-touch Interaction
Text
BitmapFont text
Multiline Text
Render Texture
Primitive Drawing
Masking
Filters
User Plugins

Basic Usage Example
// The application will create a renderer using WebGL, if possible,
// with a fallback to a canvas render. It will also setup the ticker
// and the root stage PIXI.Container
const app = new PIXI.Application();

// The application will create a canvas element for you that you
// can then insert into the DOM
document.body.appendChild(app.view);

// load the texture we need
app.loader.add('bunny', 'bunny.png').load((loader, resources) => {
    // This creates a texture from a 'bunny.png' image
    const bunny = new PIXI.Sprite(resources.bunny.texture);

    // Setup the position of the bunny
    bunny.x = app.renderer.width / 2;
    bunny.y = app.renderer.height / 2;

    // Rotate around the center
    bunny.anchor.x = 0.5;
    bunny.anchor.y = 0.5;

    // Add the bunny to the scene we are building
    app.stage.addChild(bunny);

    // Listen for frame updates
    app.ticker.add(() => {
         // each frame we spin the bunny around a bit
        bunny.rotation += 0.01;
    });
});
How to build
Note that for most users you don't need to build this project. If all you want is to use PixiJS, then
just download one of our prebuilt releases. Really
the only time you should need to build PixiJS is if you are developing it.
If you don't already have Node.js and NPM, go install them. Then, in the folder where you have cloned
the repository, install the build dependencies using npm:
npm install
Then, to build the source, run:
npm run build
How to generate the documentation
The docs can be generated using npm:
npm run docs
The documentation uses Jaguar.js and the jsdoc format, the configuration file can be found at scripts/jsdoc.conf.json

free-for.dev
Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all in order to make informed decisions.
This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings that have free tiers for developers.
The scope of this particular list is limited to things infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.
This list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work done by 500+ people, you too can help by sending Pull Requests to add more services or by removing ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.
You can find the list on GitHub or on a dedicated web site free-for.dev.
NOTE: This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a Free Tier and not just a free trial. If the Free Tier is time bucketed it has to be at least a year.

Deep Learning Papers Reading Roadmap

If you are a newcomer to the Deep Learning area, the first question you may have is ""Which paper should I start reading from?""


Here is a reading roadmap of Deep Learning papers!

The roadmap is constructed in accordance with the following four guidelines:

From outline to detail
From old to state-of-the-art
from generic to specific areas
focus on state-of-the-art

LeakCanary
A memory leak detection library for Android.
“A small leak will sink a great ship.” - Benjamin Franklin



Getting started
Add LeakCanary to build.gradle:
dependencies {
  debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.0-alpha-1'
}
That's it, there is no code change needed! LeakCanary will automatically show a notification when a memory leak is detected in debug builds.
What's next?

Note: LeakCanary 2 is in alpha.

Check out the migration guide.
Here is the change log.
To set up LeakCanary 1.6, go to the 1.6 Readme.

Fundamentals
What is a memory leak?
In a Java based runtime, a memory leak is a programming error that causes an application to keep a reference to an object that is no longer needed. As a result, the memory allocated for that object cannot be reclaimed, eventually leading to an OutOfMemoryError crash.
For example, an Android activity instance is no longer needed after its onDestroy() method is called, and storing a reference to that activity in a static field would prevent it from being garbage collected.
Why should I use LeakCanary?
Memory leaks are very common in Android apps. OutOfMemoryError (OOM) is the top crash for most apps on the play store, however that's usually not counted correctly. When memory is low the OOM can be thrown from anywhere in your code, which means every OOM has a different stacktrace and they're counted as different crashes.
When we first enabled LeakCanary in the Square Point Of Sale app, we were able to find and fix several leaks and reduced the OutOfMemoryError crash rate by 94%.
How does LeakCanary work?

The library automatically watches destroyed activities and destroyed fragments using weak references. You can also watch any instance that is no longer needed, e.g. a detached view.
If the weak references aren't cleared, after waiting 5 seconds and running the GC, the watched instances are considered retained, and potentially leaking.
When the number of retained instances reaches a threshold, LeakCanary dumps the Java heap into a .hprof file stored on the file system. The default threshold is 5 retained instances when the app is visible, 1 otherwise.
LeakCanary parses the .hprof file and finds the chain of references that prevents retained instances from being garbage collected (leak trace). A leak trace is technically the shortest strong reference path from GC Roots to retained instances, but that's a mouthful.
Once the leak trace is determined, LeakCanary uses its built in knowledge of the Android framework to deduct which instances in the leak trace are leaking. You can help LeakCanary by providing Reachability inspectors tailored to your own app.
Using the reachability information, LeakCanary narrows down the reference chain to a sub chain of possible leak causes, and displays the result. Leaks are grouped by identical sub chain.

How do I fix a memory leak?
To fix a memory leak, you need to look at the sub chain of possible leak causes and find which reference is causing the leak, i.e. which reference should have been cleared at the time of the leak. LeakCanary highlights with a red underline wave the references that are the possible causes of the leak.
If you cannot figure out a leak, please do not file an issue. Instead, create a Stack Overflow question using the leakcanary tag.

Recipes
If you think a recipe might be missing or you're not sure that what you're trying to achieve is possible with the current APIs, please file an issue. Your feedback help us make LeakCanary better for the entire community.
Configuring LeakSentry & LeakCanary
LeakCanary is released as two distinct libraries: com.squareup.leakcanary:leaksentry and com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android which depends on leaksentry.
LeakSentry is in charge of detecting retained instances. Its configuration can be updated at any time by replacing LeakSentry.config:
class DebugExampleApplication : ExampleApplication() {

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    LeakSentry.config = LeakSentry.config.copy(watchFragmentViews = false)
  }
}
LeakCanary is in charge of dumping the heap and analyzing it. Its configuration can be updated at any time by replacing LeakCanary.config:
disableLeakCanaryButton.setOnClickListener {
  LeakCanary.config = LeakCanary.config.copy(dumpHeap = false)
}
Watching objects with a lifecycle
In your application, you may have other objects with a lifecycle, such as fragments, services, Dagger components, etc. Use LeakSentry.refWatcher to watch instances that should be garbage collected:
class MyService : Service {

  // ...

  override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    LeakSentry.refWatcher.watch(this)
  }
}
Counting retained instances in production
com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android should only be used in debug builds. It depends on com.squareup.leakcanary:leaksentry which you can use in production to track and count retained instances.
In your build.gradle:
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leaksentry:2.0-alpha-1'
}
In your leak reporting code:
val retainedInstanceCount = LeakSentry.refWatcher.retainedKeys.size
Running LeakCanary in instrumentation tests
Add the leakcanary-android-instrumentation dependency to your instrumentation tests:
androidTestImplementation ""com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android-instrumentation:${leakCanaryVersion}""

Add the dedicated run listener to defaultConfig in your build.gradle:
android {
  defaultConfig {
    // ...

    testInstrumentationRunner ""android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner""
    testInstrumentationRunnerArgument ""listener"", ""com.squareup.leakcanary.FailTestOnLeakRunListener""
  }
}

Run the instrumentation tests:
./gradlew leakcanary-sample:connectedCheck

You can extend FailTestOnLeakRunListener to customize the behavior.
Icon and label
The activity that displays leaks comes with a default icon and label, which you can change by providing R.mipmap.leak_canary_icon and R.string.leak_canary_display_activity_label in your app:
res/
  mipmap-hdpi/
    leak_canary_icon.png
  mipmap-mdpi/
    leak_canary_icon.png
  mipmap-xhdpi/
    leak_canary_icon.png

   mipmap-anydpi-v26/
     leak_canary_icon.xml

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<resources>
  <string name=""leak_canary_display_activity_label"">MyLeaks</string>
</resources>
Uploading to a server
You can change the default behavior to upload the leak trace and heap dump to a server of your choosing.

FAQ
Can a leak be caused by the Android SDK?
Yes. There are a number of known memory leaks that have been fixed over time in AOSP as well as in manufacturer implementations. When such a leak occurs, there is little you can do as an app developer to fix it. For that reason, LeakCanary has a built-in list of known Android leaks to ignore: AndroidExcludedRefs.kt.
If you find a new one, please create an issue and follow these steps:

Provide the entire leak trace information (reference key, device, etc), and use backticks (`) for formatting.
Read the AOSP source for that version of Android, and try to figure out why it happens. You can easily navigate through SDK versions android/platform_frameworks_base.
Check if it happens on the latest version of Android, and otherwise use blame to find when it was fixed.
If it's still happening, build a simple repro case
File an issue on b.android.com with the leak trace and the repro case
Create a PR in LeakCanary to update AndroidExcludedRefs.kt. Optional: if you find a hack to clear that leak on previous versions of Android, feel free to document it.

How do I share a leak trace?

Go to the leak screen, click the overflow menu and select Share Info.
You can also find the leak trace in Logcat.

How can I dig beyond the leak trace?
Sometimes the leak trace isn't enough and you need to dig into a heap dump with MAT or YourKit.

Go to a heap analysis screen, click the overflow menu and select Share Heap Dump.

Here's how you can find the leaking instance in the heap dump:

Look for all instances of leakcanary.KeyedWeakReference
For each of these, look at the key field.
Find the KeyedWeakReference that has a key field equal to the reference key reported by LeakCanary.
The referent field of that KeyedWeakReference is your leaking object.
From then on, the matter is in your hands. A good start is to look at the shortest path to GC Roots (excluding weak references).

How many methods does LeakCanary add?
0. LeakCanary is a debug only library.
How do I use the SNAPSHOT version?
Update your dependencies to the latest SNAPSHOT (see build.gradle):
 dependencies {
   debugCompile 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.0-alpha-2-SNAPSHOT'
 }
Add Sonatype's snapshots repository:
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
      url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
    }
  }

Status of the snapshot build: 
Who's behind LeakCanary?
LeakCanary was created and open sourced by @pyricau, with many contributions from the community.
Why is it called LeakCanary?
The name LeakCanary is a reference to the expression canary in a coal mine, because LeakCanary is a sentinel used to detect risks by providing advance warning of a danger. Props to @edenman for suggesting it!
Who made the logo?

@pyricau quickly made the first version of the logo. It was based on cliparts from Android Asset Studio, mixed with the selection from a photo of a Canary. The exclamation mark means danger, the shield stands for protection, and the bird, well, is a canary.
@romainguy turned the ugly logo into a nice vector asset.
@flickator designed a much nicer logo for LeakCanary 2.0!
