       "[\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWelcome to freeCodeCamp.org's open source codebase and curriculum!\\nfreeCodeCamp.org is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit with the goal of helping millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.\\nOur full-stack web development curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nCertifications\\nThe Learning Platform\\nFound a Bug\\nFound a Security Issue\\nContributing\\nLicense\\n\\nCertifications\\nfreeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginning programmer around 300 hours to earn.\\nEach of these 30 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.\\nYou can pull in these test suites through freeCodeCamp's CDN. This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local computer's development environment.\\nOnce you’ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certification specific to you.\\nThe one exception to this is in the event that we discover violations of our Academic Honesty Policy. When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.\\nHere are our six core certifications:\\n1. Responsive Web Design Certification\\n\\nBasic HTML and HTML5\\nBasic CSS\\nApplied Visual Design\\nApplied Accessibility\\nResponsive Web Design Principles\\nCSS Flexbox\\nCSS Grid\\n\\n\\nProjects: Tribute Page, Survey Form, Product Landing Page, Technical Documentation Page, Personal Portfolio Webpage\\n\\n2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification\\n\\nBasic JavaScript\\nES6\\nRegular Expressions\\nDebugging\\nBasic Data Structures\\nAlgorithm Scripting\\nObject Oriented Programming\\nFunctional Programming\\nIntermediate Algorithm Scripting\\n\\n\\nProjects: Palindrome Checker, Roman Numeral Converter, Caesar's Cipher, Telephone Number Validator, Cash Register\\n\\n3. Front End Libraries Certification\\n\\nBootstrap\\njQuery\\nSass\\nReact\\nRedux\\nReact and Redux\\n\\n\\nProjects: Random Quote Machine, Markdown Previewer, Drum Machine, JavaScript Calculator, Pomodoro Clock\\n\\n4. Data Visualization Certification\\n\\nData Visualization with D3\\nJSON APIs and Ajax\\n\\n\\nProjects: Bar Chart, Scatterplot Graph, Heat Map, Choropleth Map, Treemap Diagram\\n\\n5. APIs and Microservices Certification\\n\\nManaging Packages with Npm\\nBasic Node and Express\\nMongoDB and Mongoose\\n\\n\\nProjects: Timestamp Microservice, Request Header Parser, URL Shortener, Exercise Tracker, File Metadata Microservice\\n\\n6. Information Security and Quality Assurance Certification\\n\\nInformation Security with HelmetJS\\nQuality Assurance and Testing with Chai\\nAdvanced Node and Express\\n\\n\\nProjects: Metric-Imperial Converter, Issue Tracker, Personal Library, Stock Price Checker, Anonymous Message Board\\n\\nFull Stack Development Certification\\nOnce you have earned all 6 of these certifications, you'll be able to claim your freeCodeCamp.org Full Stack Development Certification. This final distinction signifies that you’ve completed around 1,800 hours of coding with a wide range of web development tools.\\nLegacy Certifications\\nWe also have 3 legacy certifications from our 2015 curriculum, which are still available. All of the required projects for these legacy certifications will remain available on freeCodeCamp.org.\\n\\nLegacy Front End Development Certification\\nLegacy Data Visualization Certification\\nLegacy Back End Development Certification\\n\\nThe Learning Platform\\nThis code is running live at freeCodeCamp.org.\\nOur community also has:\\n\\nA forum where you can usually get programming help or project feedback within hours.\\nA YouTube channel with free courses on Python, SQL, Android, and a wide variety of other technologies.\\nA podcast with technology insights and inspiring stories from developers.\\nLocal study groups around the world, where you can code together in person\\nA comprehensive guide to thousands of programming topics\\nMedium's largest technical publication\\nA Facebook group with over 100,000 members worldwide\\n\\nJoin our community here.\\nFound a bug?\\nIf you think you've found a bug, first read the Help I've Found a Bug article and follow its instructions. If you're confident it's a new bug, and have confirmed that someone else is facing the same issue, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so we can reproduce the bug.\\nFound a security issue?\\nPlease don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to security@freecodecamp.org and we'll look into it immediately.\\nContributing\\nPlease follow these steps to contribute.\\nLicense\\nCopyright © 2019 freeCodeCamp.org\\nThe content of this repository is bound by the following licenses:\\n\\nThe computer software is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license.\\nThe learning resources in the /curriculum and /guide directories including their subdirectories thereon are licensed under the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
